game help you 'learn and play'  'god games' in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational say research  a us researcher have suggest that game such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages ravi purushotma believe that the world of the sims can do a better job of teach vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods the inherent fun of game play could help to make learn languages much less of a chore say mr purushotma  there must be few parent or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console be hard to resist by children that really should be do their homework but instead of fear computer game ravi purushotma believe that educationalists particularly language teachers should embrace game one goal would be to break what i believe to be the false assumption that learn and play be inherently oppositional he say he believe that the phenomenal ability of game such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences be ripe for exploitation the hard part of learn any language say mr purushotma be the basic part of learn what different word refer to and how they be use to build up sentence bore lessons drum vocabulary into pupils couch in term they do not understand have make many languages far harder to learn than they should be the way we often teach foreign languages right now be somewhat akin to learn to ride a bike by formally study gravity he say  by contrast say mr purushotma learn via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they be study at all this be because the sims do not rely solely on word to get information across to players instead the action of its computer control people and how they interact with their world often make clear what be go on the incidental information about what a sim be do could reinforce what a player or student be suppose to be learn say mr purushotma by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context for instance he say in a version of the sims adapt to teach german if a player misunderstand what be mean by the word energie the action of a tire sim stumble then fall asleep would illustrate the mean if necessary detail textual information could be call upon to aid players' or students' understand  one of the drawbacks of the sims say mr purushotma be the lack of speak language to help people brush up on pronunciation however online versions of the sims in which people have to move in meet the neighbour and get to know the local town could be adapt to help this although not wish to claim that he be the first to suggest use a game can help people learn mr purushotma believe that educationalists have miss the potential they have to help  get a simulate person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and have them describe in a foreign language could be a powerful learn aid he believe before now he say educational software title suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds find in game but he say use pre-prepared game worlds such as the sims have never be easier because tool have be make by its creators and fan that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game this could make it easy for teachers to adapt part of the game for their own lessons i'm hop now to re-create a well-polished german learn mod for the sequel by this summer he tell the bbc news website i'm encourage to hear that others be think of experiment with japanese and spanish earlier work with a colleague on use civilisation iii to teach students about history show that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solve a society problems can not always come from make a single change a report on the experiment say students begin ask historical and geographical question in the context of game play use geography and history as tool for their game and draw inferences about social phenomena base on their play mr purushotma ideas be air in an article for the journal language learn and technology

roundabout continue nostalgia trip  the new big-screen version of the magic roundabout release in the uk on friday be the latest attempt to turn children television into box-office gold  recent years have see a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit five children and it previously film by the bbc in 1991 he-man and transformers which be cartoon favourites in the 1980s will soon receive their own costly makeovers with screen versions of the a-team the dukes of hazzard and even blake seven on the card nostalgia be clearly big business but some critics complain that these expensive take on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals the new version of the magic roundabout which will be release as spring in the us replace the stop-motion model of the 1960s tv show with polish computer-generated animation  in a similar fashion the 2004 thunderbirds use human actors and special effect in place of the original puppets and model the film be squarely pitch at younger audiences pop star robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voice in the magic roundabout while the now-defunct boy band bust perform the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have be win over there have nonetheless be a significant backlash this cg-animated adventure airbrush the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which make the 60s stop-motion roundabout a cult hit write stella papamichael on the bbc movies site  and the recent puppet comedy team america world police be in part provoke by its directors' outrage that gerry anderson thunderbirds be remake without its signature mannequins dan jolin review editor of empire magazine say classic children tv show have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention  i can understand why people be take these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kid of today but i think it backfire what next - the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chase after them despite thunderbirds' disappoint global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recoup $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze show no sign of abate it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment  after the success of garfield the movie britain shabby tabby  surely deserve his own film vehicle with only 13 episodes make of the 1974 series there be plenty of room to explore the live of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ  furry recyclers  have already have one big-screen out - 1977 wombling free but with environmental issue still occupy our thoughts it be high time they make a comeback advance in special effect technology could do wonder for the bbc supernatural comedy   and the success of pirate of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv most popular cartoon buccaneer   it might also remind viewers the lewd character name often associate with the show never actually exist  the magic roundabout be out in the uk on 11 february how about bring catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money  thundercats i love it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort be put in it will bring my youth back  get your hand off the clangers be nothing sacred  make a movie version of the banana split  what about keanu reeve and richard gere in a remake of the wooden top or perhaps robbie williams could get his much moot act career off the grind by take on the role of andy pandy  you forget to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldn't be better than the original series could it  it always nice to see these old toons re-released but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song) i think i've be completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memories  i think remake be a good idea as the world move on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe i believe this be the whole reason retro have become so popular as long as a remake do justice to the original then all it can do be create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally i'd like to see cartoon such as transformers thundercats and mask get full hollywood remake  leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film be apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grow up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson  love to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least a 15 rat  part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout be that the character be not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they be moody sarcastic and rather human just look at the picture of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not be preserve dougal never smile like that film of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that make the show special in the first place  i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film it get all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story bod would likely be play by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two  it all very well and good remake these classic tv show and film with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience but for me a lot of the original charm be lose when they do this and seem more like a money make exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinvent or improve it it maybe that to an audience who have never see the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grow up with all these show such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which be part of our childhood they be never go to live up to expectation it do pose the question though that with all the long line of remake be make be film-makers run out of original ideas  all i can say be bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids' show ever i recently re-watched some episodes and realise that there be a level of humour show in danger mouse that be completely lose on me when i be a child  there be a new captain pugwash cartoon make a couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia program the animation - this time computer create flat-cell like animation - fail to match the original cut out paper technique for inventiveness and be woefully inadequate we live in a sample world - the music industry have be pludering past decades for inspiration clip sound from 20 years ago be much cheaper and easier that do something new seem that the film and tv be do the same now - it just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than be dare and try something new  it get to be mrbenn the story line about a man who change in a fancy dress shop step into a door way and appear in another time and place would be amaze if they get a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it be a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its go to be an adventure then johnny depp play a role similar to the pirate of the caribbean character  muffin the mule perhaps  after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know  why can't the british film industry try make gerry anderson ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people  in today media it seem the past be the future tv show such as battlestar galactica have new remake dj be sample or re-working 70 and 80 music even computer game from 10-15 years ago be get modern re-workings personally i think it show that no one have any originality any more why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone  mary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she live in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasn't even there  i'd like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner  it demonstrate a profound lack of imagination in today film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there be plany of modern children book that would make excellent film or tv program why not use them instead of rehash the past  mr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead  would have love to see dungeons & dragons make but unfortunately the film that it be make into didn't come up to scratch the only one that isn't to be remake as yet be thundercats which i'd like to see  i'm an expat live in norway and i recently go through a period of buy the dvds of many of my favourite children program for my 2 daughters my dearest wish however be to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavian  rainbow  i believe that childrens classics should be leave well alone and i will not be surprise if the magic roundabout do not do well at the box office especially since it will be go up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because it original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it do all those many years ago  how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bodoh the list could go on and on  if a transformers movie be indeed on the card then i'll be the first one on amazon buy a copy eagerly wait at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price i don't care till then i'll have to make do with the citreon c4 advert  i'd luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams do the voice it wouldnt be the same and who remember trap door voice by the late willie rushden superb children programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torchhmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at 34 i'm show my age -)  noggin the nog be one of the best children program the problem with bring it to the big screen be that no-one could approach oliver postgate wonderful voice so in general leave well alone the originals be good because they be of their time and the methods use be an integral part of the story  just imagine what could be achieve by use cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturb hand antic of the beard hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like fingermouse  bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clown krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall  one puppet show that i personally would love to see make into a live action movie be joe 90 it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe car of course gerry anderson supermarionation be a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen big-budget action it be only that thunderbirds the movie be targetted as a children't movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those show with such affection be now the parent of children themselves  it only because the people who be children when these program be first show have grow up and be plunder their childhoods isn't it i'd hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that 'done in a shed' clunkiness and you couldn't recreate the magic perhaps if the remake be do in a 'look around you' mock-authentic style i might be interest   chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega  this re-gurgitation of old film and tv show make me angry - it be corporate laziness rest on the safety of other people ideas because it guarantee to bring in the $$$ the same can be say of modern day pop band who release other people material will young etc the sad fact be nostalgia sell big buck in the short-term the fact that they will be forget in 6 months time be irrelevant (eg starsky & hutch) hence the market be saturate with this mindless drivel but it can only be stop if people stop buy it  i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies i'm only 27 and don't remember the series from when it be on tv but have the set on dvd and it a classic the fact it so great come from the fact that there be very few special effect involve and compare to today stuff it look amateurish thats the appeal though it so innocent (like chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they do remake it

mac mini herald mini revolution  the mac mini be launch amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month but do the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things deal with at the outset - yes the mac mini be really really small and yes it be another piece of inspire apple design there be more to be say on the computer size and design but it be worth highlight that the mac mini be a just a computer inside that small box there be a g4 processor a cd/dvd player a hard drive some other technical bits and bob and an operate system a dvd burner wireless and bluetooth technologies can be buy at extra cost and if you do not have a monitor keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also  it be not the fastest computer for the money but for under £400 you be get something more interest than mere technical specifications - apple software the mac mini come bundle with mac os x the operate system as well as ilife 05 a suite of software which include itunes web browser safari iphoto garage band and idvd i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp come with a better suite of program than mac os x  of course users of open source operate system linux draw up their own menu of program for people who want to do interest things with their music photos and home movies then a mac mini be an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer it a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who want to leave the tyranny of window and viruses say mark sparrow technical and review editor at mac format magazine he add in essence it a laptop in a biscuit tin minus the screen and the keyboard the software bundle that come with the mini make your average budget pc look a bite sick the relatively low price of the machine have also encourage the more technically-savvy to experiment with their macs one user have already create a dock to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car  the small size of the machine make it a practical solution for in-car entertainment - play movies and music - as well as navigation another user have mount his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then control the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse when it be first announce some pundits think the mini be design as a sort of stealth media centre - ie the machine would be use to serve tv program music film and photos - partly due to its small live room friendly design but there be obvious reason why this be not the case - at least not in the here and now the hard drive - at 80gb for the larger model - be too small to be realistically use as media centre  while commercial personal video recorders be on the market with smaller than 80gb hard drive it be worth remember that they only store tv content a media centre computer have to store music file and photos and as such 80gb just seem too small most pcs run windows media center have at least 120gb hard disk couple with the lack of a tv tuner card a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundle with the machine then the mac mini should be judge on what it be not what it be not but that have not stop more enterprising users from adapt the mac mini to media centre use so - be the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in compute graham barlow editor of mac format understandably have a rather partisan viewpoint it just a mac but we should be very excite - it revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs) look (looks better than pcs) and the fact that it the first mac design to really go for the low-cost pc market the design of the mac mini be further evidence of a future when pcs be more than just bland bulky box there be a number of company who already produce miniature pcs base on mini-itx motherboards but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options base around microsoft media center software but for the value the mac mini offer bring some of the best software package within reach of more consumers than ever before apple be to be congratulate let us say then that if the mac mini be not a fully fledge revolution - it be a mini revolution

brown come out shoot  labour may have abolish hunt - but that didn't stop chancellor gordon brown use his budget to fire both barrel at some of the opposition parties' core election fox  specifically it saw him attempt to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families in a relatively short speech he keep the best for last and be clearly out to give exactly that pre-election boost everyone have be predict so if you be a couple with children a pensioner a patient or a youngster there be something pull from mr brown red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government like a surgeon he attempt to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the group the government need to appeal to in the election campaign  the announcements bring great cheer from his own mps who be now in full-on election mode and have be look to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps they obviously believe he have do that for them and coincidentally give his own image as a prime minister-in-waiting another little boost  labour mps for example will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive - a lovely old labour word - this chancellor really be but gordon brown be never go to put on a show and even as he be out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term his demeanour remain quiet confident and reassure prudence make an appearance albeit towards the end of his address as he assure voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he have bring to britain and which he claim would be throw away by anyone else accord to the opposition party however it be all one big con trick  as always they accuse him of gloss over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finance which they claim would ensure tax increase after the election he do it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he have pledge not to increase income tax as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claim for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income be meaningless  tory leader michael howard say the chancellor be up to his old trick of deliberately re-casting his forecast to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder be as fresh as the day it be first store away for future use he brand it a dodgy vote now pay later budget base on dodgy figure from a dodgy government that give britain the dodgy dossier where the chancellor mostly avoid direct electioneer mr howard felt no such constraint with attack like compare mr brown forecast to the prime minister forecast on iraq weapons of mass destruction as ever there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties' treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor red book which set out the fine detail of his budget in an attempt to spot the flaw in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal and in labour circle there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election

call for action on internet scam  phone company be not do enough to warn customers about internet rogue-dialling scam accord to premium phone line regulator icstis  it have receive 45000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections divert to premium rate number without users' knowledge phone company refuse to pay compensation because they say call must be pay for they must warn people earlier about possible fraud icstis say  people who use dial-up connections can be affect by the scam without realise a program can be download which divert internet call via a premium phone line victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill icstis spokesman rob dwight say phone company should get in touch with their customers sooner if my bill go over the usual £50 a month i want to know about it straight away - i don't want to be tell when it hit £750  phone company have the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic he say we alert them to the number that we have under investigation and they should be look out for these number he add  telecoms ombudsman elizabeth france say certainly i would not be surprise to find my credit card company phone me if i do something out of the ordinary so i would expect phone company to be look to see if they can have a similar approach the biggest phone company bt say it be do what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dial its advice to customers be to use call bar if they want to prevent call to premium line because under the current system once the call have be make there little that can be do  gavin patterson group manage director for bt consumer say we do look at customer call pattern and we do make interventions when they be out of the ordinary we're look at the moment at whether we can improve this but as bt handle 180 million call a day monitor be quite a task in itself he add the government have order a review of premium line service and be likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future at the moment it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal service down  i use free anti-virus software (avg) and free firewall protection (zonealarm) both of these tool have prevent unauthorised access and outgo call inadvertently and innocently cause by my daughter love of music sit how about isps inform all customers of such facilities the responsibility clearly fall with the customer but many fall prey through simply not know how to avoid these issue  ignorance be and always have be an expensive business  do any one know what happen once this fraud have be commit and recognise the phone company pay the people who obtain money fraudulently so be these people follow up and prosecute   these diallers be mainly download from sit offer illegal mp3s porn and pirate software if people didn't visit such sit they'd be considerably less at risk whatever happen to personal responsibility it seem everyone have to be a 'victim' these days  part of the blame have to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operate systems a secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user knowledge  these scam be illegal and telephone company should have nothing to do with them they should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators or be they themselves receive such good return that it be in their interest to keep the scam go  why don't bt et al block all premium number by default and only turn it off at the customer request to anyone who fall foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these call after you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions they cannot insist on you pay the bill to do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud no customers have yet be take to court for refuse to pay these bill  disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus you would not walk out in the freeze cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your pc stop blame the phone company - it not their fault  i be very impress with our phone company recently i have keep ring a hotline number for kylie ticket and next day they ring back to ask if i be aware there be 40-odd call to the same number great service and i get the ticket as well  i have a colleague who have fall victim to this kind of scam he inform the phone company about it they subsequently put a block on premium rate number three months later another huge bill of over £1000 come in - the block apparently didn't work and he still have to pay for it even though a block be in place phone company be probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill otherwise they'd be take extra step to prevent this kind of problem  i have be scammed of £139 the operator will do nothing about this and to add insult to injury i be charge vat by the government  premium rate number have be subject to various scam ever since they be invent one example be where thieve would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phone whose quarterly bill be never pay the telephone company be the victim here and you can bet that loophole be block very quickly  i know people who have run up large bill despite be it-literate from talk to bt in belfast i believe that they will shortly be give out a free application that can stop you dial expensive number without know it not the fault of phone company and at last they be do something about it  it about time that the profiteer by the 'legitimate' phone company come to an end mainly by do away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly  i haven't fall victim to a rogue-dialling scam but i think you're seriously remiss in not point out that the vast majority of these scam arise from people try to access service purport to provide free pornography in most case the user be entirely at fault which be probably why the telephone company be rightly unwilling to refund them  my telephone supplier do not inform me that my monthly bill have rise from its normal £3 to £5 to £320 this be because of the scam they simply bill me what particularly gall me over and above have over £300 steal be that the supplier and the government (through vat) be profit from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses  how about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate call that you would have to contact your provider to have lift that way you could use legitimate premium rate number while limit fraudulent usage at least any dispute amount would be limit far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it be £750  a few years back i be also the target of such scam but thank god i have already upgrade to broadband and nothing be connect to my modem so all i hear be the sound of an attempt connection  how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software be up to date that should prevent the vast majority of these scam

ghost town the buzzcocks - ever fall in love with someone happy mondays - kinky afro mcalmont & butler - yes joy division - love will tear us apart angels be middle-of-the-road rubbish  angels be a awful piece of sentimental claptrap it musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrate a bite like mr williams himself this result isn't very surprise though the brits have a long history of celebrate rubbish music  best of the last 25 years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it do kind of make it a bite of a hollow award really not much competition in the last 25 years after all  it alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years  there be no way on earth that song should have be vote the best of the last 25 yearsit a travesty  rubbish who vote it for it to be include in any list i be a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the mass who wouldn't know a good song if it jump up and bite them on the nose but be certainly not the best song of the last 25 years how depress and just when we think manufacture 'pop' be on the way out - where on earth do this dreadful list appear from  while i be bias in that i think love will tear us apart should have win in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which be popular because of novelty then again well do robbie good show  you've get to be kid  angels be a great song but not the best song of the last 25 years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits  i think angels be a great song and deserve to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years right enough it be better than some of the others in this catergory for example what be will young do be nominate in the first place - he be alright but the song isn't that good i'm happy for robbie himself though  best song in the last 25 years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs release in the 80s and pretty much all of them be better than angels phil collins doesn't deserve award for all the good songs he write angels be an overrate song that get tiresome even before you have finish listen to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufacture rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who work hard for there glory receive award  so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it proof that music and democracy just don't mix still at least it wasn't will young  oh it all just a bite of fun people take these award too seriously robbie have millions of loyal fan while even non-fans know the word to angels him win obviously reflect who vote in these award personally i want will young to win but that be not really due to his musical talent  i hate the song all it bring back be memories of school disco and no-one to slow-dance with  i agree about angels i never get feed up hear it whenever the song come on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along (very badly that be why the radio have to be turn up to drown my voice out) the song make me calm and serene and happy well do robbie  i think that although robbie williams be a good performer that angels isn't really that good a song it certainly isn't anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush  angels be a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chamber it a song that will be play forever and bridge all age group  robbie do in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these award it be always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example they weren't cool at the time but because they be cool again now show that the songs have greater longevity than people think  yes angels be the best song since the past 25 years because it touch the soul as it carry a lot of mean  i've always dislike angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens teens and middle age women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as classic songwriting it 'orrible it seem obvious to me that people who like robbie be people who don't particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engage in that madness one experience when fall under the spell of pop music angels add nothing - it be merely an irritate distraction - a wasp that refuse to go away on a summer afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you vote for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off apply this uninformed filter and cast this ridiculous vote booo hiss  angels best song you be kid right last five years i might be will to accept but 25 no way do whoever vote for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say 1995 really quite insult to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century  no surprise about robbie williams consider the list where on earth do the nominations list come from compile by an eleven year-old girl perhaps i mean will young come on  what a load of crap best song in the last 25 years - i don't think so what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list be endless but robbie williams doesn't even come close  what a joke that song have become such a bane to me that i have develop a pavlovian response to the word 'angels' where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tell me the radio off why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels which have become the anthem for millions of romantic sop (think how many time it be sing on pop idol for example and by whom) should be vote the best song of the past 25 years be beyond me if this be the song against which all others be judge then musicians may as well give up  why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list be very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last 25 years i think not i didn't realize radio 2 have so many listeners under the age of 10  people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last 25 years not a chance i think the person as oppose to the song have be vote for here  the great british public at work again it a mediocre sentimental and safe song grant it not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths (in particular how soon be now) or anything from the stone roses' first album nope  no because i'm not female and i'm not 10  ok i like robbie and angels be a decent song but it be no way the best song of the past 25 years the shortlist wasn't great but him win it be a joke  predictable and laughable  the success of angels at this years brits reflect poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years the british public be brainwash by the corporate pulp that be presneted to them as cut edge music and true talent be be sadly miss whilst angels be a popular song it be not even the best song in robbie repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years  i be a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there be a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influence music today unfortunately they be leave out of the list  have radio 2 listeners even hear of joy division a band who through two albums have have a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will  no doubt about it there not a song do by anyone with more emotion and feel some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels have hit home with a far larger audience than any other song  it should have be joy divisionthose guy have play an influential part in shape modern day music while angels remain yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspire their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have do for music today  yes i think its a brilliantly write song with different mean to different people there be other great songs in the category but somebody have to win robbie be a deserve winner  i be astound that such a second-rate record have beat such a line up of amaze songs it a terrible song vote for by the mass who don't have the brain to appreciate innovative and excite music  the best song of the past 25 years really come on this be surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down  it just go to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose it confirm one thing - the british public be consistently dull - &lt(  no offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulate cheesy pop song for kid no one agree with this and quite frankly it be an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin  i think robbie deserve it he have be the most iconic of any star we have have in britain since john lennon and be an idol to millions worldwide anybody who say he doesn't deserve it be jealous of his success the only real challenger be queen but hey another one bite the dust  obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk vote for it  if this be the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry be in trouble sure robbie be talented and produce excellent material but this be not the best record  a sad day for music  it not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it be a good song and appelas to most people that why it have be vote best song of the last 25 years it a good all-rounder just like robbie  best song in 25 years since 1980 i'm confuse angels isn't a bad song it a nice catchy formulaic anthem that tick all the box but this be not great music if anything it regressive bland even i suppose it just more evidence of how redundant the brit award have become  grant angels be a good song however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition the queen song be lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices be pathetic also why weren't the stone there david bowie etc there be so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it be simply the fact that robbie wasn't get more award so they have to make one up for him  best song of the last 25 years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasn't bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful  angels be without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserve the title of best song in 25 yearsperhaps the vote have more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song don't get me wrong i'm not dispute his look but there be more deserve winners  it would have be a travesty have angels not win without angels robbie williams may well not be where he be now and britain would have be deprive of one of its most charismatic and talented perform artists it have to be see perform live with 125000 people sing along to be fully appreciate well do rob  i find it hard to believe that 'angels' be the best we have to show for the past 25 years i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously play at weddings and funerals because people think it have deep meaning' what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only make fantastic songs but also make change do something different why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular  i've nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year the brits have prove to be nothing more than a bargain tool between the pop moguls to boost band profile and record sales the same go with the scissor sisters i think this be a superb record and thoroughly deserve the newcomer award but the album come no where near u2 new record neither be they in the same league once again there have be some baffle discisions make they be not for artisic reason but for profit  no surprise really it vote for by the general public since when do they have taste in music  personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritate songs i have ever hear  it absolutely deserve to win it be a song that have unite the generations and will continue to be play for many years to come  it an absolute joke however most of the original 25 be very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise   the song be overplay and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that be leave it should have go to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didn't end up in the hand of will young though  although it have nostalgia value there be no way it deserve to win everybody know the word to bohemian rhapsody nothing compare 2 u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent  although angels be a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this be not the best song of the last 25 years this be just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that all it mean

kennedy cautious optimism  charles kennedy be far too canny to make any grand claim about how his party may fare at the general election  in his 22 years in the commons he have see his fair share of such claim dash on the rock of bitter experience and he might say the uk political and electoral system but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this be a party and a leader that believe it may well be on the way to something special in a few months' time look i have already say i be not go to put any artificial limit on our ambition this time around he say he still seem to accept that the most likely outcome be another labour victory of some sort and his general election pitch be design around the notion of the lib dems as the real opposition  but doesn't that lead to the jibe that his be a party actively bid to come second he be prepare to go this far a clear conclusion have be reach include by conservatives that the conservatives be not go to win this election therefore the potential be there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election give that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win this be really go to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experience but haven't we be here before with suggestions in the 1980s that labour be finish won't voters look for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives the problem be that geographically the conservative party have melt away in about a third of britain we have supplant them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain and they be a party with an age and decline membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain  mr kennedy be also eager to dispel any impression his party be the new party of the leave and be likely to attract mostly disillusion labour voters  he insist his three headline commitments to be finance from a 1% tax increase on those earn over £100000 a year will appeal right across the political spectrum they be to replace the council tax with a local income tax provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fee he also believe be the only major party promise to increase tax will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy do to old labour i think the tax argument have move on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election he say under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise while the tories' plan to increase spend in some areas while also reduce tax be just incredible he claim  we be be straightforward with people say you know there be likely to be an increase in the tax burden we be only recommend one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies  that be a clear cut choice for people one i be very comfortable with and i think will distinguish us from the others as to his own future he be clear if as expect his party increase its show at the election he intend to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to lead it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us that last remark reflect a view gain grind in westminster that if the tories do as badly as some fear the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side

football manager score big time  for the past decade or so the virtual football fan among us will have become use to the annual help of championship manager (cm) indeed it seem like there have be a cm game for as many years as there have be pcs  however last year be the final time that developers sport interactive (si) and publishers eidos would work together they decide to go their separate ways and each keep a piece of the franchise si keep the game code and database and eidos retain right to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game so at the begin of this year fan face a new situation eidos announce the next cm game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst si develop the exist code further to be release with new publishers sega under the name football manager so what do this mean well football manager be the spiritual successor to the cm series and it have be release earlier than expect at this point cm5 look like it will ship early next year but give that football manager 2005 be by and large the game that everybody know and love how do this new version shape up  a game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics it have an obscene number of playable league an obscene number of manageable team and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully research and compile by a loyal army of fan but that do not do justice to the game really what we be talk about be the most realistic and satisfy football management game to ever grace the earth  you begin by pick the nations and league you want to manage team from for instance england and scotland that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish league but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south of course you might be look for european glory or to get hold of abramovich millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan  the list go on a very long way once in a team you will be tell by the board what they expect of you sometimes it be promotion or a place in europe sometimes it be consolidation or a brave relegation battle it might even be a case of champion or else obviously the expectations be link to the team you choose so choose wisely then it be time to look at your squad work out your tactics see how much cash if any you have get to splash have a look at the transfer market sort out the train schedule and make sure your backroom staff be up to it then bring on the match which be once more available in the ever-improving top down 2d view with the exception of the improve user interface on the surface not much else seem to have change  however there have be a lot of change under the bonnet as well - things like the manager mind-games which let you talk to the media about the opposition boss the match engine be also much improve and it be more of a joy than ever to watch in fact just about every area of the game have be tweak and it lead to an ever more immersive experience  with a game that be so complex and so open-ended there be of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sort of problems that have blight previous release with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between match though there have be improvements in this area and a sport like football which be so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be model quite to everybody satisfaction but this time around a great deal of hard work have be put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up be cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay and if there be problems further down the line sport interactive have indicate their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible in all there be many more tweak and improvements if you be a fan of the previous cm game then fm2005 might make you forget there be anything else before it if you be new to the genre but like the idea of try to take margate into the premiership spur into europe or even put rangers back on the top of the tree fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever make just be warn that the family might not see you much at christmas  football manager 2005 out now for the pc and the mac

what high-definition will do to dvds  first it be the humble home video then it be the dvd and now hollywood be prepare for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition  high-definition give incredible 3d-like picture and surround sound the dvd disk and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at be still a number of issue to be sort out but when high-definition film do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high-definition future be an excite prospect he have work on the star war dvd trilogy find nemo the incredibles and indiana jones there be a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world be two completely separate worlds he tell the bbc news website  the technology we be deal with now mean they be very much conjoin the film that we see in theatres be come from the same digital file that we take the home video master he say but currently put a master feature film onto dvd require severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition film demand as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explain i would love to be able to show people what project that we work on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very excite  high-definition dvds can hold up to six time more data than the dvds we be use to it will take time though to persuade people who spend money on dvd players to buy the different players and display require to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months' time mr dean be confident though i think if they see real hd [high-definition] not some heavily compress version of it there be such a remarkable difference i have hear comment from people who say the image pop off the screen  high-definition will mean some change for those work behind the scenes too on the whole produce film for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression be need equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd when we master movies right now our data rat be run at about 12 gigabits per second say mr dean our dvds that we put out today have to be squash down to about five or six megabits per second that a huge amount of compression that have to be apply - about 98% so if you have anything that allow more space you don't have to compress so hard studios could fit a lot more market material game and feature onto high-capacity dvds currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months say mr dean although the step of down-converting will be bypass this will realistically only save a day work say mr dean one of the most time consume elements be build dvd navigation and menu systems on the fairly complex star war disk make sure the menu button work take 45 human hours alone if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone have to pay if the decision on the studio side be that they be go to put a lot more on these disk it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that be require and if studios do focus on deliver more add value content think mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it those cost could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd but if the consumer be not will to pay a premium price studios will listen think mr dean  high-definition throw up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike more clarity on screen mean film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail be meticulous when we do the first hd version of star war episode i everybody be very sun-tanned but that be make-up in the hd version of episode i all these make-up line show up explain mr dean the restoration of the older star war episodes reveal some interest items too  there be scan of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots there be a file cabinet stick behind one of the doorways you never use to be able to see it because things be just blur enough during the pan that you just didn't see it what high-definition revolution ultimately mean be that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur with home theatre systems turn live room into cinemas this line blur even further it could also mean that how we get film and in what format will widen in the future we be go to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband] give a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive say mr dean but that be some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves

the uk - and i'll be vote for him  both ukip and rk-s be representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interest of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people bicker that who in the overall scheme of things really care about their petty tiff  many people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switch horse midstream and then bad mouth the steed that get you halfway seriously diminish your credibility  the very idea of political party bear out of such negative feel as euroscepticism or british supremacy be nauseate one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they be and shun them at the poll  i've always think that kilroy-silk be a self-publicising egotist and this news do absolutely nothing to alter my opinion  brilliant about time this country have a plausible party  have see the recent bbc 3 documentary and witness the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figure i can well understand why kilroy-silk feel embarrass to be associate with such people hopefully the ukip members who be interest in the political debate will support his action  fantastic news pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right the conservatives be as confuse as they have be since the mid-1990s and the extreme anti-europeans be fracture themselves into splinter group that split any vote they might get in local european and general elections robert kilroy-silk ego and vanity be his own (and his supporters') worst enemy  as a euro-enthusiast i could not be more delight by kilroy-silk behaviour he take a party that be just build up a head of steam and have expose it to ridicule by attempt a coup-d'etat he be now set about the serious business of divide it in two the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better as far as i be concern but in any eventuality the two sceptic party will exhaust their energies fight each other  if every politician with ambition to lead their party resort to form their own for that purpose we'd have ballot paper a mile long you've get to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief  whilst not be a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comment about the ukip leadership and like him i be also leave ukip i believe countless opportunities have be lose to discredit the eu and to show our people what belong to the eu really mean the eu comment last week about michael howard plan to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration be a matter for the eu and not individual member state the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  do anyone else think that it be ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk have use a latin name for his new party rather than a 'good old british' name be this indicative of the man - contradictory vain and pompous  i think mr kilroy-silk have get a very good point british politics have become too pc and as a result have no straight talk honest strong politicians they be all interest in their own career and not the people who put them in power as a result i feel our democracy be be abuse and i want it stop if mr kilroy-silk live up to half his promise he will get my vote  honestly who really care man with tan leave party with no plan to set up party with no idea  as one of kilroy-silk east midlands constituents i hope those who vote for him be proud to have be take in by such charm vacuity i feel insult by have him represent me in the european parliament  ukip try hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he make it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control be bind to fall foul of ukip democratic nature  kilroy be an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip be not he try to make it work but they didn't seem to want to grow up he be leave in the position of have to defend their gaffes to the media this new party seem a logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man i say  oh please this be an amuse irrelevance there be absolutely no chance of either of these party communicate a sensible and constructive 'eurosceptic' argument they will play a key part in win the country round to the idea of a reform more democratic more dynamic europe union future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness  the refresh thing about robert be that he be open honest and straight what other politician can claim this i have a suspicion that he talk for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like i shall be vote for him  the electorate of the east midlands vote not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip kilroy-silk be make an mep because of his position on the ukip party list he have no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament  i wouldn't write off kilroy-silk while he a clown and a one man band at the moment he a populist and that always dangerousthe man clearly have an enormous ego and look at our current political master that seem to be one of the factor in success  good luck to kilroy though i think he be do more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base be not strong enough for both party to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas be start from square one and fight a somewhat uphill battle  the man i once find cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my country knight in shin armour he express view which be now more than common amongst society today - but people be almost too scar to express them kilroy silk have secure my vote and many more like me what more i look forward to the day when he claim victory wreck the eu and rescue my great nation without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever  great stuff the longer the uk dither over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only english-speaking country fully commit to europe oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy need them  this be just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a unite front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe have multiple party with the same view point just split the vote further  thank goodness that kilroy-silk have go - now ukip at least have a chance in the election  it be very sad to see the cause of britain regain its proper relationship with europe damage by this split within ukip robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damage cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small party have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieve a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk it be a great shame this have be dissipate in in-fighting  ukip have a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy-silk conveniently ignore in the comment surround the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party be interest in let him join them and take over their leadership speak volumes veritas be the begin of the end for kilroy-silk  if he believe in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of be elect for one party then defect to another  so ukip be good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow  interest that a party commit to plain speak should have a latin name  every opinion poll point to an overwhelm anti-europe feel in this country kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he be an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we want quality school top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limit asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less tax it need courage and honesty two qualities sadly lack in our politicians kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come  well if you cannot get enough limelight be an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party it all flash and no real policy here  let hope this be the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slip into obscurity  veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i be wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represent be euroscepticism so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolise that

big war game battle it out  the arrival of new title in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchise leave fan of wartime battle title spoil for choice  the acclaim pc title call of duty have be update for console format build on many of the original elements for its part the long-running medal of honor series have add pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapt the console game rise sun call of duty finest hour cast you as a succession of ally soldier fight on world war 2 battlefronts include russia and north africa it be a traditional first-person-viewed game that let you control just one character in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark order at you on a near-identical note medal of honor pacific assault do all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action its arenas be the war pacific battle include guadalcanal and pearl harbour you play one character throughout a raw and rather talkative us soldier  both game rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keep things tick along when this work it be a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story when it do not it be tedious  a win moment be an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii you be first usher into a gunboat attack the incoming wave of japanese plan then make to descend into a sink battleship to rescue crewman before seize the anti-aircraft gun it be one of the finest set-pieces ever see in a video game this notion of shuffle the player along a studiously pre-determined path forcibly witness a series of pre-set moments of action be a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic the genius of something like half life 2 be that it skilfully disguise its linear plot by various mean of misdirection this pair of game do not really accomplish that be more concern with impart a full-on atmospheric experience  call of duty come with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation finest hour have a similar determination frame everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lot of reflective voice-overs  let you play a number of different roles be an interest ploy that add new dimension to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifice the narrative flow somewhat the game drawback could be say to be its format taste differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc the mouse control be a big reason why along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc game be allow to get away with a bite more subtlety call of duty on pc be more detail plot-wise and graphically and this new adaptation feel a little rough and ready target with the ps2 controller prove tricky not help by unconvincing collision-detection you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him checkpoints be so few and far between that when you get shoot which happen regularly you be set harshly far back and will find yourself cover vast tracts of scorch earth again and again the game want to be a challenge and be and many players will like it for that it be as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it be not as refine as its pc parent the sense of be part of the action be thoroughly impressive  both of these game feature military colleagues who be disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour and in pacific assault in particular their command and comment be irritatingly meaningless  but the teamwork element in title like this be superficial design to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all of the two game pacific assault get more things right include little point like auto-saving intelligently and have tidier presentation it engage you very well and also look wonderful make the most of the lush tropical settings that be reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we have to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them finest hour be by no mean bad and it be only because the pc original be so dazzle that this version sometimes feel underwhelming those look for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be content but they will also have a niggle puzzlement as to why it do not break a little more grind rather then just be competent

with many work in clean cater shop and hairdressing  unveil the latest increase mr blair say he want the minimum wage to become a symbol of decency and fairness for too long poverty pay cap the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families he say too often people be tell to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promote the news in edinburgh wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast the government have not accept the commission recommendation that 21-year-olds should be pay at the adult rate but say it will look again at the rate later on mr brown say we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people particularly young people enter the labour market for the first time the government have say it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage  the national minimum wage be currently set at £485 per hour for those age 22 and above and at £410 for those age 18 to 21 a £3 per hour minimum wage be introduce last october for 16 to 17-year-olds but apprentice be exempt the trade unions congress welcome the increase but have call for a £6 minimum wage by next year but the confederation of british industry (cbi) call for a pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october and david frost director of the british chamber of commerce say the level of increase each year have increase by rat far outstrip the rat of inflation what employers be say to us now be that it at a level where it start to bite into the competitiveness of company right across the country  the liberal democrats' economics spokesman vincent cable say he support the move to raise the minimum wage it not just good for the workers themselves but it lift them out of benefit and therefore be good for the exchequer too he say conservative leader michael howard say he accept the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase speak on bbc radio 4 woman hour mr howard hint the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers there be people on very low salaries very low incomes indeed who really shouldn't be pay income tax he say  it would be better to decrease tax on earn below £12000 a year with say no tax on below £6000 the losses in tax can be recoup by have a 50pc tax band for people make over £100000 our minimum wage be go to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person be only 2/3rds of the us perhaps we have to really start question why some products cost 50-60% more here than they do in the us this combine with the tax decrease would make the pound the low-paid people do make go much further  it still not good enough i get a part time job at 16 when i be do my a-levels in an attempt to get a little money save for uni this be only 2 years ago and i be get pay £275 an hour and work as hard as any of the older staff maybe it about time 16 - 21 year olds get a fair wage  we must remember that the minimum wage be only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that make employ people unattractive and encourage businesses to send work and therefore job abroad still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it an easy way for the government to do as it preach would be to insist on floor pay level for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together  any increase be certainly welcome news however for all those whine about the pressure of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them would you be happy to work for less than £505 an hour think not  so then don't expect others to either  i can't believe that so many of these comment be against the minimum wage also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earn minimum wage be lazy at school if everyone go to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you it about time that these hardworking people be reward with only what they deserve and have earn fair pay and a bite of respect wouldn't go a miss either br /&gt  this be good news the minimum wage have put a sense of equality back into a worker relationship with their employer wag be suppose to be a fair reflection of an employee efforts for too long wag be a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with in very simplistic term this put a pressure to keep low-paid wag low with the minimum wage this downward pressure be at least partly remove  it be also interest to read the comment from so call business leaders they be the first to defend the right and privilege of board to award fat-cat salaries bonuses and pension right to the select few but they be the first to attack policies that be put in place to merely defend the right of those that really make those fat cat purr  i feel there be both negative and positives to the increase on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property cost too much and only by earn more will they be able to get on in life its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be look at as more of a step stone rather than a hand out  here come the usual whine about how difficult it will be for businesses we all remember michael howard protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million job when it be introduce - funny how he go quiet on that one job have continue to increase since this humane legislation be bring in i think if any job be worth do then it worth be pay a fair wage for and £505 be hardly a fortune if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it not be run properly and if it fold a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people so everybody win except incompetent business owners  great keep at it tony i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wag employers get away with at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for work we can't afford not to pay a decent wage it not a job at any price economy goodbye sweatshops hello decency  the increase in minimum wage be a good thing live in the southwest where house price and rent have increase hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years have make live for you average 18-21 years old very difficult in the south west the increase in live cost have not be match by an increase in pay for example a job i do in plymouth be underpay to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own  i work at a large hospital where the contractors provide all ancillary service - domestic cater & porter etc - pay the minimum wage of £485 as the basic rate someone have to do these unglamorous job and earn enough to live decently how dare people suggest we be lazy or complacent for accept these job and these wag who do they think will be carry out these public service job if contractors be allow to pay as little as their consciences allow  this be definitely the right step in the right direction it show that this government care for the low income earners as well this be a million vote more good strategy isn't it  although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase its time stink i be quite prepare for a raft of 'bribes' to come from the government before the election and a raft of tax afterwards they be play us for the fool they think we be  this be extremely bad news for any business - whether they be small and medium enterprises or even large company by increase overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in cost to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage be the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothing the extra cost this increase will bring will only be reflect in the price of the goods we buy which in turn will only serve to discourage company from setting-up business in the uk or encourage those company already base here to look elsewhere the jubilation felt by low-paid workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their job  this will only lead to a reduction in job why have many of the call centre job go to india blair say the economy be strong and stable economy however consumer debt and the country debt be at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses that will have no choice but to cut the workforce  the time cannot be coincidental this be blatant electioneer and should be expose as such  andrew in derby complain that raise the minimum wage be 'blatant electioneering' i don't mind if it be in our degrade democracy elections be the one time when elites really have to worry about do something concrete for the majority my only complaint be the paltry figure be discuss if my maths be right a 35 hour week at £505 give you an annual income just over £9000 and raise it to £6 leave it under £11000 the unions should be put the government under pressure for much more businesses complain might like to take a look at corporate pay shareholder payouts and profit before wonder if pay a live wage be really a control factor in the viability of their firm  i be all for lift the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost we be already see a sweep change in it work be lose to india where people be pay much less it be difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad be classify as weat shop' but now we be tell it be global competition with our manufacture industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve there have to be something at the top of the food chain and that be manufacture the whole picture need to be look at  this be great news but that might be because i work for minimum wage seem a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job when you can earn more from claim than you can from work there be no incentive perhaps a step in the right direction  if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close - this will put more people out of work how then will the government fudge the unemployment figure the government know it be not big business that keep the economy go but the smes but we always get overlook they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries after all they be predominantly own by foreign company we be a specialist company but with these increase have already have an effect on us and we have lose work another one will close us  while i'm delight for those on low pay that this increase be be put forward i be extremely concern at the implications for small businesses as an employee for a small nursery i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who have be unable to increase salaries for higher pay employees because of last october increase for the lower pay employees - who be originally be pay slightly above the minimum but be now on the minimum this latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship if the rate rise to £6 then i can foresee many small businesses have to pay off employees  the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rat to maintain the differential the raise be well above inflation and without significant increase in sales it will mean that i will not be take on a new member of staff as plan and i will be look to reduce the total hours work by the other members of staff overtime be the first to go  i currently employ 42 staff whose wag mirror the national minimum wage increase above inflation be fine but all of my business be conduct with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rise in my service delivery 80% of my cost be labour the other aspect that be always hide be that the thresholds for tax credit do not move in line with these increase so that all that happen be that employees tax credit support be reduce by the amount of the increase thereby save the government money but increase the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it be very good that the government have decide to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status job  i know about this great idea - don't bother get qualifications laze about at school no need to do anything other than attend so your parent don't get fin because remember when you do eventually start work doesn't matter how lazy you be you'll be guarantee a decent wage the ones who suffer be the employers  i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowance and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they be help or be this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door  i don't believe in the minimum wage at all i think job should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wag they should earn them now before everyone think that i be some rich-kid i can assure you i be not i come from a very much work class background and start work 20 years ago on a youth opportunity program earn £25 per week i work hard go to college part time get my a-levels and degree & better myself i now earn a 6 figure salary i do that through hard work and get off my backside a minimum wage just make people complacent  to ashley of swindon when you earn £25 per week it be worth something these days that £25 would need to be near to £60 to have the equivalent buy power i might add that thank to successive governments hold down the tax allowance threshold below inflation people earn the minimum wage be pay tax that they never would have do 10 years ago at equivalent wag in my day type arguments be a view that belong in the 'your day' - 20 years ago  as a graduate work for minimum wage i welcome any increase of pay i can get i disagree with ashley swindon say i have to work harder to get more pay i have my gcse a-levels and a degree and have choose to work for a small business that can't afford the wag i should be get i should be on at least 3x what i'm get but they can't afford it we all work hard but the money be just not there but on the plus side i love my job and wouldn't change it just to get more pay  as an employer of staff in several shop the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per year these next rise will cost me more i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers so no one really win in the end  in answer to emma from sleaford regard no one really win in the end on the contrary mr blair win - he win because he obviously have announce this to be a vote winner and his treasury win because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increase will rise and of course not only will be pay out higher wag but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well if the minimum wage increase again and if it hit anywhere near the £600 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business go bankrupt - namely mine think of us employers as well mr blair we be not all big corporations earn millions  all workers should be entitle to a fair day pay for a fair day work how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtain a mortgage or save towards retirement  it be good news for many asians live in uk students who do odd job can increase their income and can help there family in their home country i thank mr blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage

why cell will get the hard sell  the world be cast its gaze on the cell processor for the first time but what be so important about it and why be it so different  the backers of the processor be big name in the computer industry ibm be one of the largest and most respect chip-makers in the world provide cut edge technology to large businesses sony will be use the chip inside its playstation 3 console and its dominance of the game market mean that it now have a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and game platforms the technology inside the cell be be herald as revolutionary from a technical standpoint traditional computers - whether they be household pcs or playstation 2s - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer the cell technology on the other hand use multiple cell processors link together to run lot of calculations simultaneously  this give it process power an order of magnitude above its competitors whilst its rival be work on similar technology it be sony which be the most advance the speed of computer memory have be slowly increase over the last few years but the memory technology that accompany the cell be a huge leap in performance  use a technology call xdr create by american firm rambus memory can run up to eight time faster than the current standard be promote by intel perhaps more important than any of the technology be the cell role in the imminent war on live room the big trend predict for this year be the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as dvd players and hi-fis company like microsoft and sony believe that there be a lot of money to be make by put a computer underneath the tv of every household and then offer service such as music and video download as well as give an individual access to all the media they already own in one place  microsoft have already make its first tactical move into this area with its windows media center software which have be adopt by many pc makers sony have a stab at something similar with the psx - a variation on the playstation - last year in japan although this attempt be generally see as a failure both company believe that increase the capabilities of game console to make them as powerful as pcs will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack  sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoy by microsoft and intel be not allow to extend to this market by create a radically new architecture and use that architecture in a game console that be sure to be a huge seller they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the live room shut out their rival once they have establish themselves under the tv there be no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional pcs and instigate a regime change on the desktop cell be in fact specifically design to be deploy throughout the house the link between the multiple processors can also be extend to reach cell processors in entirely different systems  sony hop to put cells in televisions kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip each cell will be link to the others create a vast home network of compute power resources of the cells across the house can be pool to provide more power and the link can also be use to enable devices to talk to each other so that you can programme your microwave from your tv for example this digital home of the future depend on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there be as with all things a number of reason it could fail because the processor be so different it require programmers to learn a different way of write software and it may be that the changeover be simply too difficult for them to master you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel be not go to sit around and let cell take over home compute without a fight microsoft be go to be push its xbox 2 as hard as possible to make sure that its technology not sony will be under your tree next christmas intel will be furiously work on new design that address the problems of its current chip to create a rival technology to cell so that it doesn't lose its desktop pc dominance if cell succeed in become the live room technology of choice however it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future the revolution might not be televise but it could well be play with a videogame controller

the 'ticking budget' face the us  the budget proposals lay out by the administration of us president george w bush be highly controversial the washington-based economic policy institute which tend to be critical of the president look at possible fault line us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions be in for a dose of shock therapy without major change in current policies and political prejudice the federal budget simply cannot hold together news coverage of the bush budget will be dominate by debate about spend cut but the fact be these will be large cut in small program from the standpoint of the big fiscal trend the cut be gratuitous and the big budget train wreck be yet to come under direct threat will be the federal government ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund as soon as 2018 the fund will begin to require some cash return on its bond hold in order to finance all promise benefit  the trigger for the come shock will be rise federal debt which will grow in 10 years by conservative estimate to more than half the nation total annual output  this upward trend will force increase borrow by the federal government put upward pressure on interest rat face by consumers and business even now a grow share of us borrow be from abroad the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrow from the central bank of japan and china among other nations this do not bode well for us influence in the world the decline of the dollar be a warn sign that current economic trend cannot continue the dollar be already sink before too long credit market be likely to react and interest rat will creep upwards that will be the shock  interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as house automobile other consumer durables agriculture and small business some will recall the news footage of angry farmers drive their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late 1970s there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget the public outcry will force congress to act whether it will act wisely be another matter how do this happen  by definition the deficit mean too little revenue and too much spend - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation federal revenues be at 1950s level while spend remain where it have be in recent decades - much higher in addition the unite state have two significant military missions the bush administration choose remedy be the least feasible one reduce domestic spend or eliminate waste fraud and abuse be toothless because this slice of the budget be too small to solve the problem indeed if congress be rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spend leave law enforcement space exploration environmental clean-up economic development the small business administration house veterans' benefit aid to state and local governments would all but disappear it fantasy to think these routine government function could be slash the biggest spend growth areas be defence (including homeland security) and health care for the elderly and the poor to some extent increase in these areas be inevitable the us population be age and the nation do face genuine threats in the world but serious save can only be find where the big money be save in health care spend that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieve with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private brute force budget cut or spend cap would ill-serve the nation elderly and indigent  on the revenue side the lion share of revenue lose to tax cut enact since 2000 will have to be replace  some rearrange could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes finally blind allegiance to a balance budget will have to be abandon there be no good reason to fixate on it anyway moderate deficits and slowly rise federal debt can be sustain indefinitely borrow for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years make sense the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reform can be pursue first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness erode by the bush tax cut second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spend over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform one thing be certain - destroy the budget in order to save it be not go to equip the us economy and government for the challenge of this new century

brits debate over 'urban' music  joss stone a 17-year-old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit award her victory have reignite the debate about what urban music be   i'm not really comfortable with the word urban it a word that be manufacture in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seem to cover such a broad range of black music that it wrong how far be the brits remove from inner-city music and what people be do it so far remove that i don't expect them to get it bang on the music industry isn't champion music from our particular genre very well anyway people don't feel like that anything to do with us i don't feel like urban music just be celebrate by [joss stone] win or her be nominate or by the brits acknowledge that there an urban music scene because it all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day it not really relevant if joss stone be the closest thing that they feel comfortable champion because of what she look like and how she sound and who she sign to then so be it it get nothing to do with what really go on urban as a genre be very broad if you look underneath urban there be a number of core elements that include hip-hop r&b garage and into that obviously come soul joss stone be a soul artist her first album be call the soul sessions so urban be a very broad brushstroke that be the umbrella over the top of sub-genres and there be offshoots of all of those joss stone have have amaze success [in the us] give that she a uk artist what have really capture everybody imagination be that here you have a 17-year-old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tune and she look good - i think that what do it  the award for best british urban act be vote for by viewers of mtv base i don't think joss be not a worthy winner she make soul music and that definitely come under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that she from devon be the interest thing because most of the music we cover be make in large cities and she literally rural the great thing about urban music be that there a big range if there be some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think that where you can call it urban - that where this new sub-category or uber-category have come from joss stone be certainly not old enough to have have some of the experience of an older soul singer but you couldn't argue that she be be inauthentic with her emotions - it be come from somewhere genuine it have to come across as real that the only cut-off point we have here and that the only way by which we judge people what urban mean to us as an organisation be the politically correct term to describe music which originate from a black background music should become inclusive and if we be fight for a multi-cultural britain then we should be fight for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accept within the urban music community i think act from other ethnicities do classical music and rock should be accept too race doesn't make a difference if everyone be include out of all the award dish out yesterday i'm still try to find out what people of other race receive any sort of recognition or award a type of music (especially street music) that originate from a city and typically reflect or be characteristic of urban life  she might not be urban but when do r&b become the hip hop taint thing it be now r&b stand for rhythm and blue remember  that joss stone be rubbish be certain if anyone deserve to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip-hop soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stake a good claim  she definitely deserve to win a prize joss stone albums be quite simply amaze easily better than anything else that be release last year this whole debate about what be urban what isnt urban be completely pointless and probably fuel by urban artists who weren't nominate or didn't win i cant see why people can't just congratulate her for the talent that she be  she do deserve it but i agree with the comment about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the state they tend to use hip hop and r&b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what i'm talk about very strange  what in a name a rise by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analyse it the term 'dance music' be mislead because it doesn't describe everything you can dance to  whilst i agree that the term 'urban' be open to interpretation it strike me as simply weird that joss stone have win 'urban' to me be what i hear be play in party in the inner cities - i live in brixton and have never hear the soul sessions pump out of of a bass heavy sound system in any party i've be to good luck to joss stone let celebrate her victory - let also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia key and outkast - we didn't see a single black artist on stage collect an award  so what you're say be that any music that have black heritage be not allow to be sing by anyone who isn't black and if it be then they shouldn't be acknowledge for it even if they're pretty dam good at it she 17 have an amaze voice and win good on her oh but she not black well let make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didn't the so-called 'public' vote on this one  this idea of pigeonhole whatever be popular at the time be no different than what be happen in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz be the media then call anything that have a swing beat syncopate melody or soulful feel jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blue would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different style at that time jazz be and remain such a massively misunderstand term and so what of urban music in truth it a lazy term to categorise music that you don't really understand soul and garage be worlds apart musically (marvin gaye v tuff jam) but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of award win then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it be rather than what it represent  i demand a prize for rural music suck to the cities- it way better out here we have hay for one thing  exclude her from what have become know as urban music would be as bad as exclude lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for be black surely i dont understand the point that ty be make if lemar who make music which be less soulful than joss' work win he might have say nothing (btw i'm black too)  how can she be urban if she spend most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense  i love joss to bits and don't care what her brand be - it amaze music full stop stop put it all in bracket and let just call it music and let especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music come from black origin this just set an example that it be ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour  surely the point of have an urban music category be simply to acknowledge artists that be make what be (historically) consider urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone be simply sing a certain type of music that can be consider urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person be good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it be refer to as country music or the artist for represent that style  the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk have develop in part from the controversy surround the brand of the mobo award the very term 'music of black origin' have confuse and offend many people this be particularly strange give the existence of the asian music award it appear that the use of 'black' or 'white' in relation to music make people feel uncomfortable the term 'urban' therefore have be invoke to sidestep the debate of which type of music come first 'black' or 'white' thereby render the issue colourblind the result be now a redundant new debate as to what 'urban' also mean perhaps we should have create a new term altogether to describe the various strain of soul/rnb and hip-hop one which do not also mean something else - as we have do with 'crunk'  urban be just a word that come about recently to describe black music that become popular now the word wasn't even in use or common use five of six years ago it just a way of the industry clump it all together without have to call it black music because some people be oversensitive and might call them racist for it  i'm in a band that have be call urban and i despise the label i'd hate to think i belong to any neat market niche because that all it be ever since the music channel and record comapnies try to fracture what they consider 'music of black origin' these label have be use to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some 'urban' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the label it be what it be just music  as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements make by the key executives black people should lead the music they invent  we should stop call a genre meaningless northing be meaningless the real question be would joss stone would have be that successful do the music she be do if she be black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc who ever hear of terri walker or rhian benson they be both 10 time better than joss stone and both of them have win urban music award and i think mobos  but why not brits  so what if joss stone win the urban award her music be great soul and surely that be under the 'urban' banner what if the streets have win would people be whine because mike skinner be white it seem that a lot of the fuss be about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else  urban be pc version for say black music i'm not doubt ms stone talent but why didn't jamelia or lemar get a brit this remind me of what happen to craig david and soul ii soul in the past get nominations be easy to get but pick up a brit seem to be the hardest thing  refresh to see people make reasonable intelligent comment on any topic these days more power to you people you have say it there be music you like and music you don't like - who care what label you put on it  that entire category be a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like put eminem against bob geldof she should have be nominate for best british r & b act joss stone deserve to win an award for her talents but i don't think it be very 'urban' of her to sing angels with robbie williams  urban be a nonsense term - music of black origin well doesn't that include rock music make in the inner cities well almost all band end up make music in london/manchester etc and doesn't that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesn't make any sense  why do music have to be put into a genre it music you like it or you don't simple as that  i play in a heavy metal band we be urban music as far as i'm concern we live in cities and spend our work life in an urban environment it therefore directly shape what we write musically  urban seem to be the new name for all style of black music why it need a rebrand i don't know as the name be mislead oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as they're a white rock band they won't be describe as such  joss stone have a fantastic voice and great time and delivery -

parry put gerrard 'above money'  listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt  but parry speak exclusively to bbc sport also admit gerrard who have be constantly link with chelsea will have the final say on his future he tell bbc five live steven be above money he be the future of liverpool it doesn't matter if it £30m £40m or £50m we will not accept offer but we be also realistic enough to know we can't keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpool finance parry also reveal the club be ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its propose new stadium  and respond to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insist talk on new investment be ongoing but add the door have not close on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry join liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league there have be several highs and low during his time in charge at anfield - and he have a busy summer oversee the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and manage to hold on to steven gerrard  on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parry reveal real madrid  do  ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he say they be look for ways of say they get more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid be the same - steven be not for sale but when ask if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry say i sincerely hope he will be steven know my view he know rafa view we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we be try to build a team around him we crave success as much as he do we know he ambitious and nobody can argue with that  i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season he not alone in that there be a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it be expect chelsea will test liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claim he will be in no mood to listen there have be a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have be complete myths it be suggest we have a deal tie up last summer we didn't have an offer last summer parry explain we have tell chelsea that as far as we be concern he be not for sale and we didn't want to sell him in reality it didn't go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there won't  our position be we want steven to stay but we be also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he have enough respect for us - to know that it be his decision that will be crucial you be not go to keep a player like steven against his will that just doesn't work but any idea we be go to accept offer for steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decide to sell you' be not on the agenda you can forget that parry be currently in the process of finalise fund for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which be set to open in 2007 and he confess arsenal £100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new grind - complete with name right - have give the anfield club serious food for think he say i have to say historically it be something i have be against and i have be on record as say that but i think the size of the arsenal deal be a real eye-opener  i would say in the past deal have be do frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even be worth contemplate but the arsenal deal be the sort of deal that cause you to draw breath and say 'wow - that interesting' my personal point of view be that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a share stadium some liverpool fan would find such a move highly controversial but parry counter i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it be the right partner how strong an issue be it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it be but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to that not to say we have make a decision that we will go down that road but i think it be clearly something we have to explore  on the subject of possible new investment parry reveal liverpool be still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumour of interest from the middle east that prompt the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who get frustrate by fail bid and what he claim be indecision by the board he also accuse liverpool of use him as a stalk horse to attract other bid but parry explain steve have never be use as a stalk horse there no need and that be not the way we do business we have discussions with steve over the course of 2004 i think we come close to conclude a deal in the summer but it didn't happen quite genuinely the new interest do appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have say it be of such potential magnitude and that potential be so excite we felt we have to evaluate it we be still evaluate it steve interest be take very much on its own merit his enthusiasm for the club be there for all to see and who know what the next few months will hold the door isn't close on anything we have a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in make liverpool successful that a dream we all share so as far as i'm concern the door be not close  i would take £50m if we have no investment but if we do keep him as for the stadium if it get us cash what difference do it make really  £50m for gerrard i don't care who you be the directors would take the money and it be the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality  through a cleverly word statement the club have effectively force gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think be the right thing to do  critical time for liverpool with regard to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i be hop he doesn't walk out of the club like michael owen do for very little cash  £50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over £35m  parry statements be clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construe as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players up the ante be another smart move by parry  i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed  the key be if gerrard come out and say that he be happy clearly if he isn't then we would be foolish not to sell the worry thing be who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football

mobiles get set for visual radio  the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade have be nothing less than astonish but the ability to communicate on the go be not the only reason we be hook game cameras and music players have all be add to our handsets in the last few years but 2005 could see another big innovation that won't just see a change in our mobile phone habit - it might alter the way we listen to the radio finnish handset giant nokia have be work on a technology call visual radio which take an exist fm signal from a radio station and enable that station to add enhancements such as information and picture it be not the first time that such an idea have be suggest - the early days of dab digital radio have similar intentions that never really saw the light of day  one problem be that the name visual radio lead people to think of television but reidar wasenius a senior project manager at nokia be adamant that visual radio should not be confuse with the more traditional medium he say i'm very happy to say it not television what we're talk about be an enhancement of radio as we know it today if you have a visual radio enable handset when you hear an artist you don't know or there a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you've just be listen to  that visual channel be run from a computer within the radio station and send out different kinds of information to the handset depend on what you be listen to as well as detail on the track or artist of a particular song there be also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in a similar way to digital television red button content  possible interactive content include competitions vote and even the chance to rate the song that be play but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio station who will be able to track the number of people take part in such activities on a real-time basis this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it be very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners  as the visual radio content be transmit by exist gprs technology you would need to have that service enable by your network and there will be a cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it'll be two or three pound per month say mr wasenius but typically what we see happen be the operator offer a package deal for an 'all you can eat' arrangement per month the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet work versus dial-up connections one thing that be for sure - assume that nokia retain its market share in handsets it be estimate that there will be 100 million visual radio-enabled mobile phone in circulation by the end of 2006 basically visual radio be not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we be provide tool with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before  the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio who be positive about the impact it could have on their listeners station manager steve taylor comment listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way not only do this give listeners more information on the music we play but mean they can instantly purchase things they like mp3 music download and the latest gig ticket initially visual radio functionality will be limit to two nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful it be very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them  listen again to the interview on the radio five live website

who do you think you be  the real danger be not what happen to your data as it cross the net argue analyst bill thompson it be what happen when it arrive at the other end  the financial service authority have warn bank and other financial institutions that members of criminal gang may be apply for job which give them access to confidential customer data the fear be not that they will steal money from our bank account but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities arm with the personal detail that a bank hold plus a fake letter or two it be apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else name and it be then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demand for payment start arrive identity theft be an increasingly significant economic crime and we be all become more aware of the dangers of leave bill receipt and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish  but however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank account and credit card be not able to look after their databases properly then you be in trouble it be surprise that it have take the gang so long to realise that a well-placed insider be by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system in fact i suspect that the fsa be probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing have be go on for rather a long time have anyone check bob cratchit family link to the criminal underworld i wonder and it be hardly likely to be only bank that be be target health authorities government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sit like amazon must also offer rich pick for the fraudsters the good news be that better audit be likely to catch out those who access account detail that they be not suppose to and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements bank should have good enough record and log to trace the people who might have access the account detail fortunately there be now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involve take a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plug it into a usb slot and suck down customer file  company like securewave for example can restrict the use of usb port just to authorise devices or even to an individual personal memory card these solutions be not perfect but it do not feel like a wave of fraud be about to wash away the entire financial system however the warn do highlight one of the major issue with e-commerce and online trade - the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the 'back office' it have be clear for years that the real danger in pay for goods online with a credit card be not that the number will be intercept in transit but that the shop you be deal with will be hack  in fact i do not know of a single case where an e-mail contain payment detail have lead to card fraud  there be simply too many e-mail pass over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud cd universe powergen and many other company have leave their databases open and suffer the consequences and just last week the online bank cahoot admit that its customer account detail could be read by anyone who could guess a login name whether it be external hackers break in because of poor system security or internal staff abuse the access they get as part of their job the issue be the same how do we make sure that our personal data be not abuse any organisation that process personal data be of course bind by the data protection act and must take proper care of it unauthorised disclosure be not allow but the penalties be small and the process of prosecute under the act so convolute as to be worthless in practice this be not something we can just leave it to the market the consequences of have one identity steal be too serious and market respond too slowly after all i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my account that i do not even consider it when i hear about their security problems i doubt many others have close their account especially when there be little guarantee that other bank be not go to make the same sort of mistake in future the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that company really feel the pressure to improve their internal process or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practice whose customers suffer from identity theft i have never felt comfortable with the us practice of sue everything that move partly because it seem to make lawyers richer than their clients so i know which i'd prefer  bill thompson be a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

ukip secret weapon  by any measure new yorker dick morris be that thing americans love over everything else - a winner  this be the man who some pundits believe be almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton sensational 1992 comeback victory but morris be no ideologue he have work as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay now he be back in london as the uk independence party not-so-secret electoral weapon after return from the ukraine where he help - you guess it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko if there be one regular criticism level at morris it be that he be too ready to switch allegiances that he enjoy the game more than the politics  so why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes be not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the loom general election on this subject morris appear almost evangelical  i be on a cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so be ukip leader roger knapman i have just write a piece say how the english channel be now wider than the atlantic which he like and it go from there but what be it about ukip that particularly attract him many might think it be simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world be not terrorism but bureaucratism a great soundbite but a surprise come from a new yorker post 11 september it be the growth of these body compose of experts who know better who don't believe in let democracy govern but believe in let the correct solution be determine that international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary fund the world bank and primarily the european union  so he be out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believe be unreformable and inherently undemocratic and he be scathing of the tory party which he also appear to believe be unreformable the tory party be schizophrenic about europe but until somebody say they be will to leave the eu they can't possibly re-negotiate anything (as michael howard be pledge to do) it like walk into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and say 'before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i be not go to shoot anybody' possibly a very american analogy but another great soundbite the basic point be that the eu seek political integration to move the entire nexus of decision make away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trust to oppose it  so be ukip job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declare no the aim of ukip be to withdraw from the eu and if it have any relation to the tories it be to stiffen the tories' spine on the issue by have a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they be refuse to move  but it not just to shift the tories i think ukip have a huge amount to do with tony blair decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it have a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro and while we be on the subject of mr kilroy-silk mr morris despatch him with another of his neat soundbites robert kilroy silk be not a team player - it be a good idea our party stand for some thing and not some one  so what be the big plan for the general election how will he achieve the breakthrough look we be not go to be form the next government he say neither do ukip have to fight every seat as with the 2004 us presidential election he say the outcome will be decide by a small number of swing seat - just as he believe it will in britain so with limit resources the aim be to target those seat and end the day with a significant group in the commons he also believe it be possible the internet could have a big part in the poll the internet be a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blog (individuals post their view in online diaries) people just do it anything can happen in the next general election there be an inherent instability at the moment labour and the tories have draw the consensus so tightly and to the leave there be room for another voice  that might he suggest lead to a hang parliament with ukip and others hold the balance of power it be a huge task surely but there be undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprise - even while most still believe it be labour for the take ukip performance in last year european elections be just such a shocker and show that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus and after all he have a reputation to sustain

parry firm over gerrard  listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt  but parry speak exclusively to bbc sport also admit gerrard who have be constantly link with chelsea will have the final say on his future he tell bbc five live steven be above money he be the future of liverpool it doesn't matter if it £30m £40m or £50m we will not accept offer but we be also realistic enough to know we can't keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpool finance parry also reveal the club be ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its propose new stadium  and respond to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insist talk on new investment be ongoing but add the door have not close on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry join liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league there have be several highs and low during his time in charge at anfield - and he have a busy summer oversee the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and manage to hold on to steven gerrard  on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parry reveal real madrid  do  ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he say they be look for ways of say they get more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid be the same - steven be not for sale but when ask if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry say i sincerely hope he will be steven know my view he know rafa view we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we be try to build a team around him we crave success as much as he do we know he ambitious and nobody can argue with that  i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season he not alone in that there be a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it be expect chelsea will test liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claim he will be in no mood to listen there have be a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have be complete myths it be suggest we have a deal tie up last summer we didn't have an offer last summer parry explain we have tell chelsea that as far as we be concern he be not for sale and we didn't want to sell him in reality it didn't go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there won't  our position be we want steven to stay but we be also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he have enough respect for us - to know that it be his decision that will be crucial you be not go to keep a player like steven against his will that just doesn't work but any idea we be go to accept offer for steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decide to sell you' be not on the agenda you can forget that parry be currently in the process of finalise fund for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which be set to open in 2007 and he confess arsenal £100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new grind - complete with name right - have give the anfield club serious food for think he say i have to say historically it be something i have be against and i have be on record as say that but i think the size of the arsenal deal be a real eye-opener  i would say in the past deal have be do frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even be worth contemplate but the arsenal deal be the sort of deal that cause you to draw breath and say 'wow - that interesting' my personal point of view be that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a share stadium some liverpool fan would find such a move highly controversial but parry counter i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it be the right partner how strong an issue be it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it be but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to that not to say we have make a decision that we will go down that road but i think it be clearly something we have to explore  on the subject of possible new investment parry reveal liverpool be still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumour of interest from the middle east that prompt the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who get frustrate by fail bid and what he claim be indecision by the board he also accuse liverpool of use him as a stalk horse to attract other bid but parry explain steve have never be use as a stalk horse there no need and that be not the way we do business we have discussions with steve over the course of 2004 i think we come close to conclude a deal in the summer but it didn't happen quite genuinely the new interest do appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have say it be of such potential magnitude and that potential be so excite we felt we have to evaluate it we be still evaluate it steve interest be take very much on its own merit his enthusiasm for the club be there for all to see and who know what the next few months will hold the door isn't close on anything we have a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in make liverpool successful that a dream we all share so as far as i'm concern the door be not close  i would take £50m if we have no investment but if we do keep him as for the stadium if it get us cash what difference do it make really  £50m for gerrard i don't care who you be the directors would take the money and it be the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality  through a cleverly word statement the club have effectively force gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think be the right thing to do  critical time for liverpool with regard to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i be hop he doesn't walk out of the club like michael owen do for very little cash  £50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over £35m  parry statements be clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construe as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players up the ante be another smart move by parry  i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed  the key be if gerrard come out and say that he be happy clearly if he isn't then we would be foolish not to sell the worry thing be who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football 
be careful how you code  a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warn former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson  if it get its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by push through a controversial measure that have be reject by the european parliament lack majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and face the possibility of court case against them if the new law be about border control defence or even the new constitution then our tv screen would be full of experts agonise over the impact on our daily live sadly for those who will be directly affect the controversy concern the patent of computer program a topic that may excite the bloggers campaign group and technical press but do not obsess middle britain after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and the way it amend article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention yet if the new directive be nod through at the next meet of one of the eu ministerial councils as seem likely it will allow program to be patent in europe just as they be in the us many observers of the compute scene include myself think the result will be disastrous for small company innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement it will let large company patent all sort of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas  in the us you cannot build a system that store customer credit card detail so that they can pay without have to re-enter them unless amazon let you because they hold the patent on one-click online purchase it be a small invention but amazon make it to the patent office first and now own it  we be relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long the new proposals go back to 2002 although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions have be go on since at least the mid-1980s they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals be make endorse by the council of minister radically modify by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form some national governments seem to be aware of the problems poland have reject the proposal and germany main political party have oppose it but there be not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection early in december the british government hold a consultation meet with those who have comment on the proposals science minister lord sainsbury go along to listen and outline the uk position but accord to those present it be embarrass to see how little the minister and his officials actually understand the issue concern  the draft directive be be put through the council as what be call an a item and can only be approve or reject no discussion or amendment be allow so why should we be worry first there be the abuse of the democratic process involve in disregard the view of the parliament and abandon all of their carefully argue amendments this go to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patent should be worry if coders be treat like this today who be to say that it will not be you tomorrow  more directly once software patent be grant then any programmer will have to worry that the code they be write be infringe someone else patent this be not about steal software as code be already protect by copyright patent be not copyright but something much stronger a patent give the owner the right to stop anyone else use their invention even if the other person invent it separately i have never to my shame manage to read lord byron childe harold pilgrimage if it be point out that one of my article contain a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claim that i have simply make it up and it be coincidence the same do not hold for a patent if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happen to be the same as the lzw algorithm use in gif file then i be in trouble under patent law at least in the us coincidence be no defence the propose directive be support by many of the major software company but this be hardly surprise since most of them be us-based and they have already have to cope with a legal environment that allow patent they have legal departments and more crucially patent of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders  even this system break down of course as microsoft find out last year when they initially lose a case bring by eolas which claim that internet explorer (and other browsers)

mourinho plot impressive course  chelsea win at fulham - confirm their position at the premiership summit - prove that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenge on all front this season  they have get strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finance no other club in the world can match all they need to add now be the big prize which as we all know be the most difficult part of all one thing be certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge win at newcastle in the carling cup and then win 4-1 at fulham which be a great result give that they have be show good form as i say win the major honour be the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho have win the biggest club prize of all the champion league and that track record and confidence transmit itself to top players it be a priceless commodity no-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by mourinho he be regard as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he have the silverware to back up the talk mourinho doesn't simply talk a good game - he win some very big game such as the champion league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the word be back up with action i've also find him to be very realistic whenever i've hear him he spend a lot of money and it seem to be work and we should remember lot of managers have spend money and it have not work the buy be now integrate and in arjen robben he have the player who be give them that extra dimension  in the early game he be slaughter for defensive tactics and yet he be win game you cannot win title early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those point on the board be vital i also think the criticism be very harsh because even though they be not score goals they be create chance by the hatful now they be take those chance have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things be look good i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injure he be start to look the part before he be sideline but you have to feel if chelsea have a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tool to go far in the champion league i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have sweep all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interest to see how mourinho prioritise things but his life will be make easier by the size of chelsea squad i have say i believe chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal be fly at the start and i have see nothing to make me change me mind  if anything what i have see have confirm my early impressions and chelsea would have take encouragement from arsenal rocky defensive display at spur even though they run out 5-4 winners mourinho have his say on that game complain five-four be a hockey score not a football score in a three-against-three train match if the score reach 5-4 i send the players back to the dress room as they be not defend properly so to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 be disgraceful  on a more serious note it be a game that merely confirm the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism have be aim at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lie with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal defence confidence be a crucial factor in defend when you start concede goals you suddenly get a chill in the bone every time the ball come into the penalty area you think oh no - then find your worst fear confirm arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheet on the board but the return of campbell be key he solidify the unit have pace and be powerful in the air and on the deck he be vastly experience and have a calm influence on all around him campbell pull it all together at the back and get the defence play as a unit chelsea have no such problems at present which be why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champion this season

athens memories soar above low  well it goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there be plenty of highs and low in athens  obviously there no get away from the differ fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but i want to remind you of a few more events that make 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics   one of my favourite olympic moments be kelly success in the 800m  win that race be the key to her success because if she win that then the 1500m would be a bite of a formality kelly have be full of should i shouldn't i thoughts about go for the double in athens i think why wouldn't you do the 800m it your best event it be such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it be nice to be able to be part of her athens story   the victory for the british men 4x100m relay team be a bite of a surprise but a great climax to the game i think the four of them - jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - know deep down that it be their best chance of a medal the lads have run poorly in the individual sprint so maybe they do lift their game when they know something be really at stake   hicham el guerrouj olympic double be a much bigger achievement than kelly on a global scale  he be the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5000m title as soon as he have add the 5000m crown and i have finish commentate i jump up run down the stairs push everyone out the way and just give him a big hug he be one of the few african runners who have embrace the tradition of the mile and he love to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham be someone i enjoy have a bite of time with even though my french and his english be not very good   what happen to paula in athens this year be the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there be a set of circumstances around athens that conspire to produce a very dramatic end which i think have be greatly misunderstand drop out of the marathon be the right thing to do but start in the 10000m five days later be not wise that be her heart and not her head react paula have a lot of little things go wrong in her preparation and on the day  things like niggle injuries not be able to do all her run sessions and feel the pressure of the race loom ahead of her i think she come to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drain and if even the smallest thing doesn't feel right when you be prepare to race a marathon 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall the positive thing to take from paula olympics it that she will have learn a lot from it and so will a lot of people - include me   purely as a race paula victory in the new york marathon have to go down as one of the most thrill it be so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya susan chepkemei and you don't usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it be also a real delight for all athletics fan because to use one of my favourite word paula show real bouncebackability and it be a bite of a rarity for me too because i genuinely do not have an inkling how the race be go to pan out   kelly and the 4x100m boys' victories paper over the crack in the general performance of the british team we should be concern that we're not produce enough people who be capable of reach finals at senior level  the only individual men finalist on the track be michael east in the 1500m i be begin to look down and wonder where be the new breed and that where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we do not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes come fourth in the 1500m and she be the highest finisher for team gb the thing be if we don't have athletes get into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the beijing olympics and beyond   i tell you what i really enjoy this year benita johnson win the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise be something special   to be honest i'm get bore with all the drug scandals especially balco i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on  have say that i'm always please when drug cheat be catch because it show the sport be stand up to it and not turn a blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco be people be start to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheat as regard the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have be hang over kenteris for a while the bottom line be we cannot keep let drug damage the sport because if we do then it stop everyone enjoy it

and to offer a warn an addiction to a game like this be far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time write travis anderson in texas some of the comment be humorous this game be so good i'm not go to get it there no way i could limit the hours i'd spend play it write charles macintyre from england  but some strike a more worry tone about the massively multiplayer online role play game (mmorpg) 'you need to get out more' could be the motto of any mmorpg shame they be get more popular as you know this problem be just go to mushroom write stuart stanton-davies in huddersfield scare-mongering article about addictive video game have exist since the days the first game of pong stop everyone from work at the atari offices  game be like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it be spend too much time in the gym in front of the television or read poetry  unfortunately game and addiction be a far too easy association to make however stories about gamers spend 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video game be become more frequent and the impact that be have on their families be quite distress for some  massively multiplayer online role play game - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of share fantasy or science fiction worlds the scope of these game - like warcraft everquest ultima among others - be epic and exploration and adventure be almost infinite part of the problem be grind - by which gamers have to perform long-winded mindless task to bring up their level and gain access to more adventure such open-endedness bring with it a desire to keep play not for no reason be everquest (eq) nickname evercrack e hayot write in the culture blogzine print culture say recently i use to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot by 'a lot' i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average and on weeks where i didn't have to work as many as 30 or 40 hours  he say that in the world of online game such behaviour wasn't that unusual lot of people i know in the game play eq that much you lie you don't go into work because you have stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watch tv (a good thing presumably) he write explain how everquest take over his time he quit the game he say because he realise life be more fun than everquest  let us be clear - such obsession be rare but the huge growth in online game mean a growth in the number of people who take their passion for a hobby too far almost 400000 people buy a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month only a fraction will descend into obsessives the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have be affect by everquest can be find on one blog everquest daily grind jane who run the website compile a chronicle of heart-rending stories i be actually convince at this point that there be more than ome' people who spend more time in mmoprgs than in reality she say one unnamed correspondent - all be anonymous - write on the rare nights when my husband do come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i be so use to sleep by myself that it be difficult to get to sleep with another body lay next to me  i can't talk to him while he be play there be absolutely no point as he doesn't hear me or be so distract that i get a 'ummm ya' a few minutes after i ask him a question  game widow have become a comedic term for women who have be shut out by male gamers but for some it be not in the least funny another correspondent write i believe that he be addict to the online game and that be the cause of his depression and restlessness and some of them be even sadder today our son be five days old the sad truth be my husband spend 11 hours today play his warcraft game he do not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there be important quest wait online video game fan often complain that their hobby be misunderstand or marginalise but as game become ever more mainstream and game ever more immersive there will be no hide place for social problems i wish 30-40 hours a week be unusual but i think it probably isn't an 11 hour stretch isn't that surprise - i've know people to play 15+ hours at a stretch i know of people who be spend their week holiday from work play warcraft i know of people who would play ever[crack] in shiftswaking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume wait for an item they 'needed' to appear i understand that the key sign of an addiction be if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life by all standards many of us be addict so be the solution to force ourselves to stop playingor do we just need to make real life a bite more interest  sadly with all the talk of people become obsess with game i find myself long to have the time to join them i have be in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that begin game have become more and more complex and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work be the main drag on my time  i think the line between play a game a lot and a game addiction be really quite distinct i play game a lot definately over 20 hours a week but i don't go miss work or other commitments in order to play game  i have about a year ago delete every game on my computer rpgs be the worst - the real world fade and all your worry sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword unlike book or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing when you stop play you're at the same point as when you start all the achievements of your 10 hour session be irretrievably lock in the game and since you've gain nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one  despite have little monetary value the reward and encouragement offer by these mmorpgs be enough to hook game for hours daily if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition perhaps the unhealthily obsess simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality  my advice to game widow be if you can't beat 'em join 'em that be try play it yourself if he want to play as well well at least you'll be together somewhere  i be an addict and it cost me my relationship i still play now but without the guilt  hehe how long have i play in one sit from morning till the early hours of the next day the bird be sing out side and i have to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder be so full i be in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink now thankfully the fascination have wear off and i have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part online game give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there be no end in sight you keep go for the mirage of the ultimate  obsessive behaviour be of course always cause for concern but it always bother me when article about game talk in term of reality obviously somebody who spend thirty hours a week play everquest have a problem this problem however have nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality an obsessive eq player do not consider the game to be real any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer consider their car to be human if mmorpgs have a unique danger in term of encourage obsessive behaviour it be not that they create an absorb virtual world but rather that they can be easily access 24/7 the problem here do not lie with the nature of game but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture  the problem with these so call mmorpgs be that you can never really complete them there always another quest to do a few of my friends have only have about 10 hours sleep since it be release friday  championship manager consume my life for years one particular session start at about 2pm on a sunday pause for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for class restart at about midday for another 10 hour session the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore game seem to be those who have rarely allow themselves to become immerse in a game i would expect their perspective to change if they be to do that  i use to be an everquest addict while i be in college it come to the point where the game world felt more real than the real one i fail alot of my course and be able to barely graduate i be lucky that i come to my sense when i do others be less fortunate and drop out of college now that i be hold a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague  when i be make redundant i tell my partner i have a new job for three months whilst every day i play everquest from 730am till 5pm when she come home i pretend i have just get in as well hence justify play it all even i have since quit play mmorpg and have a good job  when i get to the point where i be eat my dinner in front of the pc i realise things be get silly so i'm try not to spend so much time on there it not easy i feel as if i've get a real addiction go on here  for me the problem be that i love to complete a goal once it be complete that be it i be finish time to move on i become obsess to complete the goal so from that standpoint it be an addiction in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like fall into a black pit it be easier to escape into a control fantasy world than face reality at time - in other word the goal offer in the pc game be easier and more fun than the real world pretty scary implications if you think about it  i can't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it  i play star war galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these game they be all engineer in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress become exponentially slower require more and more time to reach the next level i'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i be spend entire weekend in front of my monitor slowly build up my character stop only for food and toilet break thankfully i make a clean break and actually manage to sell my jedi account for £800 - which be my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum  seven years ago i begin play ultima online this game dominate 2 years of my life they be 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experience and friends i have online game can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others something that cannot always be achieve in the day to day run of a normal life whilst i would warn against people give to much of there life to these game i believe they be a better way to spend your time than say watch tv  game be addictive and should be make a recognise addiction when i be single i use to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year build up my stats complete evermore quest and battle ogres but somehow i find time to get out even meet someone and get marry have my life change hell no i still cast spell and battle till the early hours of the morning on with the fun  online game should be enjoy just as much as you would enjoy watch television or go to the cinema or the pub with your mat  many people use recreational drug on an occasional basis and be able to lead succesfull live with families relationships and good career a minority allow drug to take over and destroy their live and become addict accord to this article the same be true of mmorpgs the message to the government be clear either legalise drug or outlaw online game  sound like there be some sad stories here - and i can believe them all i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it be i be resolute that it will not take over my life it certainly get in the way though i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves step over it  i think i'm obsess with game in general i spend far too much time play game like everquest 2 and football manager rather than go out and interact with real people and when i do try to i'm always think in the back if my mind that i'd rather be in front of the computer win the league with cambridge unite  i be obsess with online role play game it not so much quest but it have the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc i spend about five hours per day online play it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before get up for work the next morning  as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social live negatively furthermore these type of game contain a huge social aspect whereas other game and some other pursuits (such as be a couch potato) the players could be indulge in be solitary by nature  these game be like most things -- too much of anything be a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun  live in korea at the moment they have lot pc bang (internet cafes) nearly most of south koreans be addict to online game and one korean die because of the lack of food and water he have through play online game  i play xbox live every day i find my self lie and reschedule everything around my game fix the longest i play be a 24 hour straight session i know i play for to long but it an obsession that i can't control can you reccomend a counsellor - this be not a wind up but something i'm increasingly concern with  me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sit in front of a tv try to 'frag' some individual it get the balance between get home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so game and enjoy 'real' life  i buy the us version of world of warcraft when it come out the longest period i play be 23 hrs straight i give up the game after a month because it be so addictive but have subsequently just buy the european version (couldn't help myself) in future i'm go to regulate my time far more strictly great game  have play mmorpg game for some years i agree that these type of game can be life suck but my concern be for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment most mmorpg game you need a credit card to play but i dont think parent know just what they be let there children into  unless there be undeniable medical proof that star at a computer screen for hours at a time can damage a person&#191s health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse  these people be pathetic they need to get off their machine and notice that our world be be swiftly overcome by issue and trouble that make the trifle worry of and online universe absolutely meaningless  24hours when i be a kid at school and i be on half term ultima online be the game ahhhh them be the days  lol

brown and blair face new rift claim  for the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown be say to have declare all out war on each other  this time the allege rift be over who should take the credit for the government global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hop and believe be above such things it dominate the prime minister monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he be force to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour as he tell journalists i be not interest in what go in and out of newspapers there be a complete unity of purpose and he again heap praise on mr brown say he be do a great job and would continue do it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election  so why do he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincide with mr brown long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt he be ask by now mr blair have move from irritation mode to his barely disguise fury set he snap back that the hack know very well what the operational reason be for the time of his press conference well not really as it happen  and he repeat what a great man gordon be and how unite they be before again sneer that he take absolutely no notice of what go in and out of the newspapers prefer to get on with the job of do the best for the country and the world although in the next breath he declare i get increasingly alarm by what i read in the newspapers before catch himself on and quickly add in so far as i read them of course he probably have good reason to be alarm because the newspapers have be full of stories about the claim open warfare between the two men  as far as the time of the prime minister press conference be concern there be two options the first be that it be a calculate attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment if that be the case it suggest that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headline be not enough to stop the squabble the second option be that it be an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government have lose its once-famed ability to strictly coordinate announcements - through the infamous down street grid - to avert just such allegations  either way the effect be the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue and there have be previous suggestions that the new year have start with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men firstly the prime minister insist on wednesday that he have be intimately involve in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries it be claim he have be embarrass by the fact that gordon brown appear to have take the initiative over the government response to the disaster while mr blair be still on holiday in egypt  then as if to pour fuel on the flame both men separately speak about work on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mention the other all this come amid fresh claim that mr brown be still seethe that he have be exclude from a prominent role in general election plan and have as a result start to set out his own platform the fact that he use an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believe should be in the manifesto have embark on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plan and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often see as the prime minister turf - have only add to the impression of rival camp operate entirely independently of each other the prime minister deny all that as well repeat his insistence that it be inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign but the big fear with many on the labour bench now be that unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself

record fail to lift lacklustre meet  yelena isinbayeva may have produce another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it be not the best meet we have ever see in birmingham  and hey there be not many meet that go by without the russian break a world record  apparently isinbayeva have clear five metres in train and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extend the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me be all about push the barriers and be the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition mind you every time she break the record she get $30000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it world record aside i think it be a very encourage even work for kelly holmes she look good and be very positive agnes samaria who come second be in very good shape and be in the world top three 800m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there be no come back over the last 200m as kelly dominate the race so beat samaria be a bite of a benchmark for kelly my gut feel be that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasn't convince herself she be fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener be struggle to come near what be go to be require to win the men 60m in madrid he start well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners jason have a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he be struggle to maintain his pace through to the finish  it would have be nice to see what mark lewis-francis could have do in the final if only he hadn't get himself disqualify he be blatantly play the false-start game to his advantage but it trip him up and make him look a bite silly my view be you're mean to go when the gun go and not before and if you try to unsettle your rival by employ the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again have say that mark be look in much better shape but i haven't see anything from mark or jason yet which suggest france ronald pognon - who have run 645 second - will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxton victory in the 60m hurdle be the best thing to come out of the meet  something else that probably go unnoticed be melanie purkiss win the women national 400m race in a new personal best of 5298 second aaas champion kim wall come second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad go to the european championships scotland lee mcconnell be probably go to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i think meseret defar be disappoint in the 3000m but i don't think the pace-making be great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey have be in last year shape she would have give defar a real run for her money she have a go but just could not hang in there we be also expect a bite more from bernard lagat in the men 1500m but he have only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he be in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he be well beat by markos geneti but we only have half expectations for bekele as he have be struggle this season it be very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those condition affect the distance runners and in fact defar complain to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly

musical future for phone  analyst bill thompson have see the future and it be in his son hand  i buy my son max a 3g phone partly because they be so cheap and he need a phone and partly because i be suppose to know about the latest technology and think i should see how they work in real life after use it for a while i be not at all tempt to get rid of my sonyericsson p800 smart phone that have a relatively large screen even if it do only have slower gprs access to the network i can read my e-mail surf the web use a proper browser and write stuff use the stylus on its touch screen last week someone e-mail me a document that have be compress into a zip file and i be pleasantly surprise to discover that my phone even know how to decompress it for me by contrast the confuse menus complicate keyboard and truly irritate user interface of max 3g phone simply get in the way and i do not see much value in the paid-for service especially the limit web access the videos of entertainment news horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip do not appeal and i do not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image never mind micro-tv  but then max start play and i realise i be miss the point entirely  it be certainly not a great overall experience but that be largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout the video content itself be compel the quality be at least as good as the video stream from the bbc website and the image be about the same size max be completely captivate and i be intrigue to discover that i have nearly miss the next stage of the network revolution it be easy to be dismissive of small screen and indeed anyone of my generation with fail eyesight and the view that 'there never anything worth watch on tv' be hardly go to embrace these phone but just as the world wide web be the killer application that drive internet adoption music videos be go to drive 3g adoption with vodafone now push its own 3g service and 3 already establish in the uk video on the phone be clearly go to become a must-have for kid sit on the school bus adults wait outside club and anyone who have time to kill and a group of friends to impress  this will please the network operators who be look for some revenue from their expensively acquire 3g licence but it go deeper than that play music videos on a phone mark the begin of a move away from the 'download and play' model we have all accept for our ipods and mp3 players after all why should i want to carry 60gb of music and picture around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want whenever i want stream to my phone oh - and of course you can always use the phone to make voice call and send texts something which ensure that it be always in someone pocket or handbag available for other use too i have never really approve of use the internet protocol (ip) to do either audio or video stream and i think that technically it be a disaster to make phone call over the net use voice over ip  but i have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the develop western countries be fast and reliable enough to do both  i stream radio to my computer while i work and enjoy hear the bizarre station from around the world that i can find online but nowhere else i be even play with internet telephony despite my reservations and i appear on go digital on the world service stream over the web each week but 3g network have be design to do this sort of stream both for voice and video which give them an edge over net-based ip service the 3g service aren't quite there yet and there be a lot to be sort out when it come to web access and data charge vodafone will let you access its service on vodafone live as part of your subscription cost but it make you pay by the megabyte to download from other sit - this one for example this will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company collection of partner sit something that should perhaps be worry telecoms regulator ofcom but we should not see these new phone simply as cut-down network terminals if i want fast access to my e-mail i can get a 3g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network the phone be a lot more and it be as a combination of mini-tv personal communications device and music/video player that it really work there be certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sort of devices access a wide range of service over different network 3g phone and ipods can co-exist at least for a while but if i have to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carry gigabytes in my pocket or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both an mp3g player anyone  bill thompson be a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

will tory tax cut lift spirit  michael howard have finally reveal the full scale of his plan tory tax cut  should he win the next general election he have earmark £4 billion that will be use to reduce tax - although he still will not say which or how this be the pre-election message many in his party have be press for and voters he believe will warm to at its simplest it be say vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spend plan on core public service include health and education it would increase spend on defence police and pension and even after that be do it would still have enough leave over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax  all the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency save which would see the axe take to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that £23 billion would go on spend plan with £8 billion to fill the black hole leave they claim by gordon brown and the rest go in tax cut  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seem unlikely ideas already float include raise tax thresholds and abolish or reduce inheritance tax although some in the tory party be urge mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election as the tory leader declare the aim of the exercise be to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he say  it be a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggest labour be the party of tax rise and the conservatives the party of tax cut  the extension of that however be that labour be also see as the party of big spend on the public service while the tories be the cutters and that be where one of the problems lie for mr howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spend on public service and lower tax he insist he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into down street labour needle to say claim his plan £35bn efficiency save simply don't add up and that those sort of figure be fantasy  one of new labour greatest successes before the historic 1997 election be to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trust to run the economy so far that have not face any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be force to either increase taxation or tax to plug a black hole it have at the centre of its finance meanwhile the liberal democrats be commit to increase tax for the most well off to finance their spend proposals launch earlier in the day so mr howard hop his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll rat might finally lift off the floor and while other issue like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it be likely - and the prime minister probably hop - that the economy will be the decide factor

european medal chance improve  what have the european indoor trials tell us well i think we could be head to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospect  it be good to see athletes begin to make step forward to see a few new face and there be lot of personal best kick around  the best performance on the track for me be sarah claxton win in the 60m hurdle run sub-eight second twice in a week put her right up there and if she repeat that in madrid she will be close to pick up a medal but what be great about sunday performance be that she be under pressure to produce the goods when it count diane allahgreen have be our best hurdler for some time now and i think she be surprise to be beat by sarah and know that she get the better of diane in a head-to-head race will give sarah confidence in the men race on saturday allan scott be right in there and there be definitely more to come from him in fact the men 60m hurdle be so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid  phillips idowu light up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of 1730m which put him at the top of the world rank i have a chat with him before the competition and he be really look forward to get out there he feel he be in great shape and have some big jump inside him - but then phillips always have a lot of the athletes say the runway be not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that be a good performance he be such a huge talent but just need some consistency - and if he do that then the big jump will get even further across the board i think kelly sotherton have a great weekend and continue to show she be develop she pick up three personal best in the long jump high jump and 60m hurdle and you can't ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she have every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've see so far  she have a complicate train regime where different people help her with different discipline but it seem to be work really well it wasn't all good news in sheffield i think both the 60m race be disappoint in different ways jason gardener may have win but he wasn't at his best i chat to him afterwards and he know it be an off-day for him he there to be shoot at and the other lads nearly get a big scalp out there in the women race jeanette kwayke be hop to run against defend champion joice maduaka the pair be enjoy a bite of rivalry but joice have to pull out with a chest infection if she have make the final i think jeanette would have go a bite quicker  janine whitlock compete well in the pole vault on her return follow a two-year drug ban but the most disappoint thing in the wider view be that she be our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case the event have move on immensely since janine have be away and if there be more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interest topics to look out for be the citizenship issue surround mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay be a londoner who have choose to represent trinidad and tobago but have never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who come third in the 400m be from the sudan but be try to gain british citizenship he come to britain as a high jumper but damage his toe start do more run and find his talent so we shall have to see what happen to both of them

will the budget bring out smile voters  as tory spokesman oliver letwin say - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote win sweeteners wouldn't he  and everyone do indeed expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expect poll day of 5 may there will be plenty of talk about take no risk with the economy or hand out irresponsible giveaways but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fail to do something design to put a smile on voters' face and make them more incline to back labour in the election and there have already be speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increase the threshold on stamp duty in this week budget the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusion core labour voters in the fold while ensure the middle england voters who give tony blair two election victories don't desert him at the third poll  and needle to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown own ambition to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win but there be a shadow hang over this pre-election performance - in the shape of £11 billion or thereabouts that be the size of the financial black hole the tories back by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increase after the election  the open shoot in that battle be fire at the weekend with claim a treasury leak suggest mr brown be ready to slap capital gain tax on home sales to raise some of that cash it be immediately deny but the tories remain suspicious claim that as mr letwin say if the money do not come from there where will it come from  mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecast be simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise tax after the election should labour win previous gloomy forecast prove wrong he will argue while suggest that only by stick with him can britain continue to have a sound economy low unemployment and high public spend the opposition will reject that by claim they can keep the economy sound increase spend and cut tax at the same time  the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but base on increase tax to fund spend and amongst other things abolish the council tax in favour of a local income tax and there will be prolong argument over which of the party can make the greatest save in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies but probably what that all boil down to be a simple question of which of the party the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprise in the come years and it be probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election

when invention turn to innovation  it be unlikely that future technological inventions be go to have the same kind of transformative impact that they do in the past  when history take a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they be define technologies which ultimately change people live substantially but say nick donofrio senior vice-president of technology and manufacture at ibm it be not the thing itself that actually improve people live it be all the social and cultural change that the discovery or invention bring with it the car bring about a crucial change to how people live in cities give them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst have mobility and access when we talk about innovation and create real value in the 21st century we have to think more like this but faster mr donofrio tell the bbc news website after give the royal academy of engineer 2004 hinton lecture the invention discovery be likely not to have the same value as the transistor have or the automobile have the equivalent of those things will be invent or discover but by themselves they be just not go to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things do these be not altogether new ideas and academics have be explore how technologies impact wider society for years but what it mean for technology company be that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind think behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology have for them  we be in a different phase now when it come to technology argue mr donofrio industry week 2003 technology leader of the year the hype and over-promise be over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life get better as a result  in the dotcom era there be something that be jump up in your face every five minutes somebody have a new thing that would awe you you weren't quite sure that it do anything you weren't quite sure if you need it you weren't quite sure if it have value for it but it be cool but change and innovation in technology that people will see affect their daily live he say will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face it will creep in pervasively nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sort of ways through new superconducting materials to coat power and memory storage i be a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure say mr donofrio pervasive compute be where wireless compute rule and where jewellery clothe and everyday object become the interfaces instead of bulky wire screen and keyboards the net become a true network that be take for grant and just there like air people will not have to do anything to stay connect people will know their live be just better say mr donofrio trillions of devices will be connect to the net in ways people will not know natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voice could be tell our jewellery to sort out the finance  ultimately there will be say mr donofrio no value in be computer illiterate to some it sound like a technological world go mad to mr donofrio it be a vision innovation that will happen behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep compute say mr donofrio deep compute be the ability to perform lot of complex calculations on massive amount of data and integral to this concept be supercomputing it have value accord to ibm because it help humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search result find cure for diseases or understand of exactly how a gene or protein operate  but pervasive compute presumably mean have technologies that be aware of diversity of contexts command and requirements of a diverse world as compute and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture wall and clothe physical space become a more important consideration  this be go to need a much broader range of skills and experience i be confident that the set [science engineer and technology] industry be go to be short on skills he say if i be right about what innovation be you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative women tend to have those traits a lot better than men eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he say in the uk a dti-funded resource centre for women have set a target to have 40% representation on set industry board ibm accord to mr donofrio have 30% our goal be for our research team to become the prefer organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career the whole issue of global diversity be as much a business matter as it be a moral and social concern to mr donofrio we believe in the whole issue of global diversity he say our customers be diverse our clients be diverse they expect us to look like them as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership position it become and imperative for us to constantly look like them

the kop end - parry speak to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead he only dodge one question - when ask to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently court liverpool a polite smile deflect the inquiry but to his credit he meet everything else head on in measure tone that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business  by business he mean become title challengers again and lock the piece together that will help return the trophy to liverpool be parry mission parry have already successfully put one of those plank in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez and his enthusiasm for the spaniard personality and methods be an indication of his clear feel that he have strike gold benitez early work have give parry renew optimism about the years ahead but it remain a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations this will not come as news to parry a lifelong liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggest he be no mood to be find want  captain gerrard be central to liverpool plan and parry insistence that all offer will be refuse be a firm statement of intent as ever the player will have the final say and parry acknowledge that but he be determine to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish  in term of the search for new investment hawkpoint be appoint as advisors to flush out interest in march 2004 thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra come and go while the most serious statement of intent come from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan morgan have a succession of bid reject have come close in the summer only for talk to break down over potential cost for the new stadium bbc sport understand morgan be still ready and will to invest in liverpool and parry have keep the door ajar despite currently seek investment elsewhere  morgan however have have no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december blame indecision at board level as he publicly withdraw his £70m offer he be also convince his interest be be use to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool morgan will certainly not be make another call so speculation continue about the new benefactor with trail lead to the middle east and america but all meet with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield  parry meanwhile see the new grind as crucial to liverpool future but be refuse to become emotionally attach to the idea he be determine the grind will only be build on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium parry will pull back the moment the figure do not stack up but there have be a vital new development in north london that have re-shaped liverpool think  liverpool have publicly refuse to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential name right - but the realism of arsenal stun £100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton have change the landscape parry label the deal an eye-opener and admit liverpool would be miss a trick not to explore the possibilities he know some traditionalist liverpool fan will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'anfield' but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain  i would take £50m if we have no investment but if we do keep him as for the stadium if it get us cash what difference do it make really  £50m for gerrard i don't care who you be the directors would take the money and it be the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality  through a cleverly word statement the club have effectively force gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think be the right thing to do  critical time for liverpool with regard to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i be hop he doesn't walk out of the club like michael owen do for very little cash  £50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over £35m  parry statements be clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construe as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players up the ante be another smart move by parry  i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed  the key be if gerrard come out and say that he be happy clearly if he isn't then we would be foolish not to sell the worry thing be who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football

what the election should really be about  a general election be the best chance most pressure group get to make a real impact on government policy here be how six lead lobby plan to make sure their cause be be debate ahead of an expect spring poll  we've call for the state pension to be increase from £7960 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £10545 that what we're call for many pensioners be disadvantage by the current system if we've get one in five pensioners below the poverty line we've get to make it more generous or have these people live in poverty  we've draw up a pensioners' manifesto this will be send to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies they will be ask which of the top five issue include the pension issue they would support once we've get their responses we will publish the result within the constituencies and nationally as well it our way of put the politicians on notice we be try to get across the fact that there be 11m voters over 60 in the country they be more likely to vote than other section of society and thirdly they be true swing voters before 1997 most pensioners vote conservative in 1997 and 2001 they vote labour but there be no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around they cannot take that vote for grant  pension generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government have postpone the publication of adair turner full report into the issue he say the uk have one of the least generous pension systems in the develop world  that the government take seriously the impact of aviation on the environment  we haven't work out specific plan but i imagine we will lobby political party and incumbent mps various local group will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national brief we don't have any large demonstrations plan but they can't be rule out  it be hard to say whether we will be successful we have get the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it be difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be push out by big issue like iraq  repeal the hunt bill  we be challenge the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action we be hop to hear in the new year whichever way the court rule the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneer time when the ban come into force on 18 february we will be go to the european court because no compensation be be pay so there a lot of legal territory to go we be try to engage with the minister by demonstrate and talk whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it be (rural affairs minister) alun michael have avoid us and cancel engagements so that make it difficult it be not intimidatory - on the whole it be group of angry housewives of course there be an element of shout because people be angry but there be no violence because that do not achieve anything  it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face it exactly what the prime minister do not want he want the issue off the table until after the election  people use live animals as target for sport both here and abroad the reason for include abroad be because of trophy hunt it be another sort of form of shoot for sport the principle be the same whether it a tiger or a pheasant  we will widely publicise what happen in relation to trophy hunt we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk we will seek to get pledge from individual mps and would-be mps say that they be against the use of animals as target for sport we would like the support of political party but i think a general election be very much to do with pledge mps make to their electors with hunt we have many mps who be happy to say they be against it  i think what we will get be a very real climb up the agenda whether or not we will get a ban i be not sure but it will mobilise public opinion everything we do will reduce animal suffer and in time that will lead to a ban  the issue that we think be the most important for this election be choice the language of consumerism be very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum choice as an ideology be begin to be the privatisation of this decade it become an issue in itself but what really miss from the debate be the consumer choice in that choice be not choice at all if all you have to choose from be two fail school we have see so many pension mis-selling scandals and in the pension industry there a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that we want choice on the consumer term - that mean clear and accessible information to operate that choice  firstly we have our website it feature our campaign and change every day secondly through our 700000 members who communicate with us thirdly through the media and also what we will be do be hold a pre-election conference we will invite the opinion formers mps journalists and others the idea be that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians  i think we will be successful it very much the language be use by the main political party politicians on all side be very sensitive to this issue they want to be see to be respond to this issue  fuel duty be a large part of operational cost for road haulage workers we have be hear about this propose increase of 192p per litre that gordon brown have be postpone and postpone tuppence do not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that an increase of about £750 if you're run 10 vehicles it obviously 10 time that  if fuel duty do rise we will be absolutely horrify there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprise if you see widespread demonstrations what it will mean be there will be a number of firm go out of business  we will continue to do what we have always do we keep the issue in the trade press regrettably it one of those stories that it be get harder to get into the national press whatever we do the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complain minority but they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it be probably go to work when you see a lorry it already at work

terror power expose 'tyranny'  the lord chancellor have defend government plan to introduce control order to keep foreign and british terrorist suspect under house arrest where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial  lord falconer insist that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protect the public against the threat of terrorism and uphold civil liberties but thriller writer frederick forsyth tell bbc news of his personal response to the move there be a mortal danger aim at the heart of britain or so say home secretary charles clarke my reaction so what it be not that i be cynical or just do not care i care about this country very much  but in the 66 years that i have be alive there have not be one hour of one day of one month of one year when there have not be a threat aim at us my point be the british have always cop without become a dictatorship we have cop with fear without become a state base on fear we have cop with threat without turn our country into a land of state threat but that be what the blair government now seek to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-qaeda tyranny  i be bear on 25 august 1938 the mortal threat back then be a scruffy little austrian call adolf hitler a week after my first birthday the threat have become reality we be at war my father wear a uniform for five years after 1945 we yearn for peace at last but in 1946 winston churchill tell us - from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain have descend across europe behind the iron curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat josef stalin trigger the cold war with the berlin blockade in 1948 my whole generation be blight by it  we be threaten by the nuclear holocaust the nuclear wind the nuclear winter we build shelter that would have shelter nothing we spend our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals we take silly precautions some fight it some march futilely against it some pretend it be not there the cold war last 43 years but we remain a parliamentary democracy by the early seventies it be terrorism as well al fatah black september red brigade but most of all for us the ira and the inla thirty more years 300 policemen and women over 600 soldier more than 3000 civilians dead but we win because even ira bomb could not force us to become a tyranny that be why the tyrants lose civil right be infringe as little as humanly possible evidence have to be take in secret to protect covert source yes  and one judge no-jury court have to be institute when juries be terrorise informants have to be give immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle but habeas corpus do not die right of appeal be not abolish now the threat be islamic fundamentalism its leaders want to destroy our society so do the ira  it be base and fund abroad so be the ira it have sleeper fanatics inside our society so do the ira it be extremely hard to penetrate with our agents so be the ira the prime movers be not easy to bring to trial neither be the ira but we do and without become a tyranny now the blair government propose the law system of fascism and communism the citizen can be arrest and hold without charge or trial not even on the careful consideration of an experience judge but the whim of a political activist call a government minister to be protect from terror the government say we must become a tyranny but a tyranny be base on the citizen terror this be not victory this be defeat before a shoot be fire  an interest article - its good to see widen participation in the debate - but i suggest we move one step further our own bomb and bullets will can only shatter peace because invade foreign nations imprison the innocent and 'hunting' in the hadows' cannot destroy an evil of the mind and hatred within the heart rather than focus upon effect we should consider the cause because terrorism do not begin with bomb why not try a foreign policy of compassion it can only enhance our democracy and share our freedom  i agree with frederick forsyth we really can't deal with terrorism by turn britain into a fascist state what we really need be more honesty from our security service and our politicians if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably isn't any our security service behave like the detective who have decide that a certain person be guilty rake over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it while the real villain get away remember there be no wmd in iraq just because a person may have make some stupid and naive decisions in life do not make them a terrorist  in this overly 'politically correct' society it be good to see someone like mr forsyth speak out yes there have be oppression by the british government in the past and overstep the mark in place like ireland but yes we be still a democracy where it be rare to be arrest without charge/trial etc (apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal for example)this country sign up to human right and then pretend that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people (defined by whom) when id card become mandatory the data collect will not be protect by the data protection act and will be readily available to people like gchq with no control by the person whose id be be check  the threat now be new you cannot compare the threats of past years with now forsyth say 3000 die over 30 years or terrorism 3000 people die in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001 the threat today be that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology a kilo of semtex will flatten a build a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist act with technology that be rapidly become accessible i agree the government be probably encourage a degree of mass-hysteria and talk up the threat but talking-down the threat and do nothing be unacceptable too  the problem with this issue be not that it isn't important but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some time that we will just let this go without tell the government no however as the nation that give the world the common law and a true sense of the right of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far  as somebody of chinese origin i can say that this country use to be a good place to migrate and start a new life whilst life wasn't perfect we could make better for ourselves now we be riddle with red tape and be tell what we can or cannot do we have to be politically-correct and we be not allow to have beliefs or opinions we have a prime minister who spend too much time meddle in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the live of british citizens at home or abroad mr forsyth have do a good job in voice his opinions let hope the bbc doesn't get gag for let people express their view the people have the right to know and the bbc role be to inform educate and entertain  i agree terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it be the government which have spread the fear by its constant publicise of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our right and liberties in the end the very thing we seek to protect be what we be give up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy the terrorists have already win  i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but exist laws seem to be more than adequate the idea that the new terrorism demand new power be erroneous the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk be scant ricin for example be a dangerous poison but it be not a weapon of mass destruction what be really worry be the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempt to manipulate the electorate through fear  if the government have its way with id card track and so on then totalitarianism have win and as such it then matter little whether we give in to the terrorists demand or not we will have lose the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tell us we have and that they seek to bring to others  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i be shock at the ease with which this government be prepare to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoy for centuries - the right not to be deprive of our liberty without a trial in open court that go right back to magna carta and ordinary people have spill their blood to enforce that right against governments who think they know best  when you look at today britain you realise george orwell be only wrong about one thing the date  frederick forsyth put it beautifully the government be seek to introduce a police state the new power of home internment without trial follow a pattern which include the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id card and the link of data base together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years we be sleep-walking into this wake up  an interest view but miss two crucial facts of this new threat 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assure destruction that keep the cold war in a state of tense balance these people will use devastate force against us without fear of any consequence 2) the terrorists be prepare to use suicide bombers which mean they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it because these terrorists be potentially so deadly we have to come up with new tougher responses it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london have be nuke we won't have much of a society leave to debate   he correct in most of what he say mind you he do seem to have forget that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably cause many idealistic if misguide young catholics to join the ira administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect now  surely we the public would be better protect if the security service rather than alert a suspect terrorist by place them under house arrest (and for how long)they be to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack  i don't usually have much time for mr forsyth largely right wing view but this time he have get it spot on there be no doubt that there be terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the uk but it be very doubtful whether al-qaeda be a global organisation coordinate this the rise of surveillance cameras id card the plan to charge for road use by track every vehicle at all time this be the stuff of nightmares add to this this new legislation which effectively mean that the protection of the law will be remove from anyone at the whim of the home secretary and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit where will this end as it stand terrorists do not need to attack the uk it government will soon have it people terrorise more that they could very achieve with a few bomb  mr forsyth have express exactly what my gut fear and reservations be about this propose legislation but could not verbalise thank you  mr forsyth seem to forget that kill in the trouble occur on both side of the religious divide and be carry out by killers from both side he also forget basic human right be suspend then as now experience judge sit over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those time for very little return and maximum alienation these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same  forsyth be wrong the nature of the current threat be new it be no longer to our arm force as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc be it be to you and i the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately the best comparison be therefore the blitz 1941 at this time let us not forget suspect (foreign and british be routinely round up and intern for the duration of the war without any complaints from the public we must not forget we be at war  i'd say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target be a when not an if probability i'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be say that the government didn't do enough to protect the uk people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it be the side that be opposite new labour and tony blair  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth the very reason this country have be such a wonderful place to live be under attack not from terrorists but from this government the perpetuation of the perceive terrorist threat be not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists be do but from our own government i believe what this government be do be at the very least highly questionable and at worst sinister at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles when we be all tag and monitor constantly our freedom be be craftily and surreptitiously whittle away by this government and we be gain nothing it should be of great concern to everyone  i be slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have live through the same history as him i be against a police state and would not like to think that i live in one i think that the attack on iraq make the international situation worse and may have provoke further act of terrorism  how true there be extremely worry parallel between britain now and germany during the 30 i never think it would be so easy to take over a country from within  mr forsyth have forget one key point the terrorists who threaten britain today be well aware that hitler stalin and the ira all fail as a result modern day terrorists be will to do things their predecessors do not that do not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be erode to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resort but to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today terrorists we may need to do things a little differently let us hope not  frederic forsythe comment seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear it be this fear which enable terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all form as mr forsythe open comment suggest  i be remind of a quote attribute to thomas jefferson a nation that limit freedom in the name of security will have neither  the government be face with an incredibly difficult task and have make a policy to deal with it it all very well criticise that policy but if mr forsythe can't draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative i say o what' to his opinions  frederick forsyth rhetoric be absurd and his conclusions laughable he distort reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour this government seek to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil right it be frederick forsyth who be the extremist because he do not appreciate the need for balance  i rarely find myself agree with my forsyth but in this instance i think he be correct the rule of law must prevail civil liberties be worth defend if the government can hold uspects' without charge or trial what next  i agree absolutely by introduce fascist type laws we loose the moral high grind in our fight against terror our democratic system be not perfect but as churchill point out it be better than all the others that have be try terrorist attack will take place but for many reason we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom  i do not usually agree with mr forsyth but he be spot on here the single biggest threat we face be that of a government dedicate to act illegally and manipulate international and national law to suit its own purpose totalitarianism always require an outside threat justify a range of extraordinary power leaders want the british government be a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation  although in principle i agree with him frederick forsyth fail to address one key point- al-qaeda attack (though obviously there have be none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people the ira want to limit the death toll of their attack so as to maintain support among the republican movement  yes i agree with mr forsyth view i do not believe the government plan be justify there be over reaction to and the negative influence of the us president interpretation of democracy and freedom he use the same arguments that be current before the wwii the war to liberate iraq afghanistan with syria and iran to come we be leave a poor inheritance for the future generations  mr forsyth be a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belong the british government be not go down the road that mr forsyth suggest sadly comment such as his will make a lot of people believe that they be govern by people who be fast become tyrants instead of be genuinely commit to stop tyranny even if the method employ to do that be at the moment alien to the british people who have live in a democracy protect by tony blair and others of like mind who mr forsyth seem to be put along side the cruffy little austrian'  thomas hobbes would be smile in his grave at labour proposition like new labour he call himself a libertarian like new labour he believe he be promote the people best interest but as forsythe criticise this government hobbes have be criticise by most subsequent philosophers for argue his way into the hand of the totalitarians simply put he argue that in favour of the ultimate liberty - the liberty to live - man should be prepare to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign as protection against his fellow barbaric man hobbes have be roundly condemn by posterity and rightly so i hope new labour suffer the same treatment  i agree with mr forsyth view the governments approach be totally against the spirit of british democracy they must not be allow to get away with it  of course frederick be wrong about britain win the war against the ira and he wrong too about the country not become a tyranny have he forget about shoot to kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squads etc  my background be somewhat similar to freddie so i be persuade to agree with many of his sentiments we can have no moral justification for impose our system of government on anyone while we be systematically deprive our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms  whilst the principle of keep potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive it be unfortunately also the first step towards totalitarianism who be to decide whom be a suspect why should we believe them who can have faith in the honesty integrity and competence of our intelligence service and politicians in light of the events of recent years what be to stop false denunciations what of those falsely accuse who will lose their career who will support their families will their children still go to school it smack to me of the methods of nazi germany stalin russia ceausescu romania - the list go on it look as if a new dark age be come  i see that opinion on mr forsyth remark be divide the problem i see be that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they don't like or be scar of but history have show that if you have laws like that they always get abuse by those in power after all today you may be scar of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scar of you and that day you'll be the one imprison without the chance of justice our laws be such that you cannot just be imprison at the whim of our police force you have to be show to be deserve of it if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we be no better that those we be fight  i never think it possible for me to agree with a single word utter by frederick forsyth but i'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one we as a nation be in grave danger of be dupe by pro us propaganda which of course also mean we'll inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our governments of any political persuasion incidentally to gradually and insidiously impose a police state by well try & test back door methods i grieve for the future of my children it no wonder they're adamant they don't ever want any of their own  this government with much fanfare sign us up to the european convention on human right but now want to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial this put it on a par with the government of burma  like many of your respondents i wouldn't usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose view i share but in the instance of oppose charles clark proposals for house arrest i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/  i agree with mr forsyth just look at the facts - our government (along with the us) invade another sovereign country (iraq) by select intelligence that back it case base on fear the facts turn out to be very different if individuals be treat in the same distort way then we've do ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bomb we become animals too  i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth have say - if we be to be respect and have influence within the world we must be see to be walk the walk as well as talk the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human right abuse when we be lock up people who may be totally innocent it be hypocrisy of the highest order mr forsyth link islamic fundamentalism to the new threat however it appear that he have misunderstand the term islamic fundamentalism it should be point out that a muslim who adhere to the true fundamentals of the qur'aan and the teach of the last prophet muhammad be an islamic fundamentalist this person do not commit suicide in any shape or form nor do she/he kill innocent women men and children this person be self-reflective and constantly try to better her/his action by be good to others the people who mr forsyth label the new threat be those who do not follow the correct teach of islam they have arrive at their own interpretations and assumptions with regard their action on top of that they claim to be follow islam in its true form  i accept that the intentions of these policies be to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where do this sort of thing have ever make any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bomb didn't stop and it could be argue that all it achieve be to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans will to take up arm against the british  be eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london it be easy to agree with him he be absolutely spot on during the ira bomb there be massive explosions in canary wharf to the right of where i write this and also to the leave in the city of london notwithstanding these and the attempt and nearly successful assassination attempt on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of 10 down street there be no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there have be on afghanistan and iraq even when england be in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there be no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like we have to see off these latest attempt on our liberties include id card which winston churchill decide have to go since he say the average bobby on the beat could not be rely on to not be tempt to take undue advantage against the citizen go about their lawful activities (incidentally i can still remember my old id card number) hence it be clear that the far too great police state power set for the statute book have to be resist and neuter  what can i add to mr forsyth eloquently put arguments except applause well do that man for stand up and be count in the war against tyranny

vouchers 'to cut winter deaths'  pensioners be be promise energy save by the liberal democrats as snow and cold temperatures continue  the party say the plan could save the average pensioner £100 every year and cut winter deaths the government give £200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60 or £300 where people be over 80 the tories promise to keep the payments the lib dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discount on home insulation shadow local government secretary ed davey say the current scheme have help some older people but this new liberal democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people die from the winter cold every year the vouchers be design to let pensioners choose from a list of approve energy supply who would compete for business by offer discount on home insulation scheme the plan would boost energy conservation say the party - and insulation could save £100 every year for pensioner households so use the money more intelligently than at present 
what price for 'trusted pc security'  you can now buy trust computers but can we really trust the pc vendors ask technology analyst bill thompson  if you have recently buy an ibm thinkvantage computer a dell optiplex or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba hp/compaq or samsung then you may have get more for your money than you realise inside your shiny new pc be an extra chip call the trust platform module (tpm) that can be use for a range of hardware-based security feature eventually the tpm will be build into the main processor itself and if the trust compute group have its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own from mobile phone to tv set top box to children toy but for the moment it be a separate piece of hardware provide enhance security feature to program that know how to use them and as part of a well-designed network system it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today a big advantage of the tpm be that it be hardware-based  at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure it might be password-protected user account data encryption program or a firewall but it all rely on program code run on an inherently insecure processor  hardware security be less common even if it be a lot safer this be partly because it be more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password but also because its more work for users systems administrators and managers as a result we settle for second best so when it come to computer security trust systems could be a major step forward after all if you have a laptop that will only run program that have be digitally sign then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run and if all your file be lock automatically then even if you get your computer steal your personal data will be safeguard at the moment support for trust hardware be not build into major operate systems instead you have to use special software like hp protecttools or wave systems' embassy this provide file encryption password management and identity protection usually for business users who connect to company network full support for the trust compute specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows longhorn this will include what microsoft in a typical act of obscurantism call the next generation secure compute base and it will give user-level program access to the trust compute hardware when that happen we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trust compute capability just as they turn on their firewall however there be a downside to the increase security from viruses spyware and data theft that this will provide  because the trust compute base be also use to make digital right management (drm) systems more secure this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music movies and book that we have buy from them we have see recently how allow digital right management service into our live can lead to unwelcome consequences users of apple itunes use to be able to stream the music they have bring to up to five other itunes users a great way of let your mat discover your music collection  but the latest version of itunes limit this capability just as an earlier upgrade reduce the number of time you could burn a select playlist of purchase songs to a cd another take away the ability to play songs download from real harmony service on your ipod apple can do this because they write the software and they control the right management once it be embed in trust hardware it will be even harder for dedicate programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use right that should be guarantee under copyright law similarly users of tivo digital video recorders have find that they cannot record some show and other program that they have record be automatically delete after a day this happen because of change that tivo have make to their software and the users cannot control it one wonder whether hardware-based drm will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content be a bad idea and that the flexibility of copyright law be something that should be embrace and not take away it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system in order for the purchaser to view the content it have to be unlock once it be unlock then someone somewhere will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlock version and once an unlock version leak onto the network it will be uncontrollable the efforts go into drm would be much better spend build efficient distribution service find business model that be base on trust your customers and offer high quality download at fair price what we want be not so much a trust compute platform as a trust customer platform the record company and the film industry need to recognise that most of us most of the time will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material they will benefit more by build a market in which i can share songs with my friends record show i want to watch later and burn cds for my kid a market which respect the spirit of copyright law and do not seek to replace it by restrictive contract or end user agreements we need to ensure that trust compute remain under the control of the users and be not use to take away the freedoms we enjoy today  bill thompson be a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
