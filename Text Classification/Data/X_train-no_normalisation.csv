How  bring Catweazle   big screen? He could give Gandalf  run   money!

Thundercats!! I love . Should  fun  see   big screen,   effort  put !   bring  youth back!

Get  hand   Clangers! Is nothing sacred?

Make  movie version   Banana splits!

What  Keanu Reeves  Richard Gere   remake  The Wooden Tops? Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get  much moot act career   grind  take   role  Andy Pandy.

You forget  mention  grearest   , Danger Mouse! But  ,  '  better   original series, could ?

It' always nice  see  old toons -released,    abysmal Thunderbirds movie (  song!) I think I'  completely put . Just leave  classics alone  good memories.

I think remake   good idea. As  world move  people tend  look      past  things  make  feel safe. I believe    whole reason ""retro""  become  popular. As long   remake  justice   original       create  wider audience  possibly entice  new generation  persons  enjoy  revive  old series. Personally ' like  see cartoon   Transformers, Thundercats  M.A.S.K. get full Hollywood remakes.

Leave  alone,  ruin something      fond memories    first place? The thunderbirds film  apalling,   patch   puppet series I grow     Magic Roundabout  never    without  voice  Eric Thompson.

Love  see Transformers  real actors  CGI. And make   least  15 rating.

Part   reason   success   classics   Magic Roundabout    character    sweet  cuddly creatures   would expect. They  moody, sarcastic,  rather human. Just look   picture   animations   new film show   characteristics    preserved. Dougal never smile like ! Films   sort   unfortunate habit  Disneyfying everthing,    lose  real magic  make  show special   first place.

I  fond memories  Bod ( least    I look like )  would like  see someone attempt  make    film. It' get   right material   american blockbuster -  plot   story. Bod would likely  play  Tom Cruise  would undoubtedly   girlfriend  two.

It'   well  good remake  classic TV show  film    latest technology   'new' audience,     lot   original charm  lose    ,  seem  like  money make exercise  cash    original success   programme  reinvent  improve . It maybe    audience   never see  originals   watch  without prejudice,   people   grow     show   Thunderbirds  Magic Roundabout   part   childhood,   never go  live   expectation. It  pose  question though     long line  remake  made,  film-makers run   original ideas?

All I  say  bring back Danger Mouse, probably  greatest kids' show ever. I recently -watched  episodes  realise     level  humour show  Danger Mouse   completely lose    I   child.

There WAS  new Captain Pugwash cartoon make  couple  years back. Again, like  many   nostalgia programmes,  animation -  time computer create flat-cell like animation - fail  match  original' cut  paper technique  inventiveness,   woefully inadequate. We live   sample world -  music industry   pludering past decades  inspiration, clip sound  20 years ago  much cheaper  easier   something new. Seems   film  TV      - '  cheaper  take ideas   past  rework , rather   dare  try something new.

It get   Mr.Benn. The story line   man  change   fancy dress shop, step   door way  appear  another time  place would  amazing! If  get  decent producer  writer  story line could  great.

I' speechless. Best song   last 25 years? Yeah right.

I  much doubt  'Angels'  even  best song   week   come . Like every track Robbie  release   single, '  blatant  poor facsimile  something  someone else   better .

Give us  break...!!!

Best song  25 years,  must  joking. Its good   like  sort  thing,  really!

Listened  Angels  Radio 1  morning  I  drive  work. Had  hear    . I love Robs voice,  lyric  tune. Perfection!

As usual,  public  short memories   come  vote  "" greatest"". There must     dozen songs   last 25 years  deserve  award . It'  exactly groundbreaking. Presumably,  age range  could  bother  vote   pretty low...

I' actually embarrass   British     best song   produce   last 25 years!!

What  The Specials - Ghost Town, The Buzzcocks - Ever Fallen  Love With Someone... Happy Mondays - Kinky Afro, McAlmont & Butler - Yes, Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart... Angels  middle---road rubbish.

Angels   awful piece  sentimental claptrap. It' musically  lyrically inept;  fantastically overrated,  bite like Mr Williams . This result '  surprise though, The Brits   long history  celebrate rubbish music!

Best   last 25 years? Maybe. Cunning  make  timescale  include Stairway  Heaven  Bohemian Rhapsody,    kind  make   bite   hollow award really. Not much competition   last 25 years  .

It' alright   pop song -   best song   last 25 years???

There   way  earth  song    vote  best   last 25 years....'  travesty.

Rubbish! Who vote      include   list? I   regular listener  Radio 2  I ' recall  invitation  vote   bland, slushy rubbish  might appeal   mass  ' know  good song   jump   bite    nose   certainly NOT  best song   last 25 years. How depress     think manufacture 'pop'    way  -   earth   dreadful list appear ?

While I  bias   I think Love Will Tear Us Apart   ,   seriousness, I think   best song   last 25 years   include songs less  5 years old   would exclude songs   popular   novelty. Then , well  Robbie, good show.

You' get   kidding.

Angels   great song,    best song   last 25 years. Only  best song     nomination   Brits.

I think Angels   great song  deserve     run    award  I ' think   best song   past 25 years! Right enough,   better     others   catergory,  example,   Will Young   nominate   first place -   alright   song '  good! I' happy  Robbie  though!

Best song   last 25 years? What  Joke! Think    great rock  pop songs release   80s  pretty much     better  Angels. Phil Collins ' deserve award    good songs  wrote? Angels   overrate song,  get tiresome even    finish listen  . Soppy rubbish  best. Hopefully manufacture rubbish  die  soon,  let  real artists  work hard   glory receive awards.

So boringly obvious  typical   bland nature  mainstream music  Britain today,   ' proof  music  democracy  ' mix. Still,  least  ' Will Young...

Oh '    bite  fun. People take  award  seriously! Robbie  millions  loyal fans,  even non-fans know  word  angels. Him win obviously reflect  vote   awards. Personally I want Will Young  win,     really due   musical talent!

I hate  song,   bring back  memories  school disco  -one  slow-dance !

I agree  Angels. I never get feed  hear . Whenever  song come   radio I turn  radio , smile  sing along ( badly,     radio    turn   drown  voice ). The song make  calm  serene  happy. Well  Robbie.

I think  although Robbie Williams   good performer,  Angels ' really  good  song. It certainly ' anywhere near  good  Love Will Tear Us Apart  Joy Division  Wuthering Heights  Kate Bush.

Angels   fantastic song. All credit  Robbie Williams  Guy Chambers. It'  song    play forever  bridge  age groups.

Robbie    way deserve  mantle. Whenever    award   always 'artists'   past five years  seem  win  best   best...We forget   late 80s  early 90s  example. They ' cool   time,     cool   show   songs  greater longevity  people think.

Yes Angels   best song since  past 25 years,   touch  soul   carry  lot  meaning.

I' always dislike Angels intensely. I believe    symbolic   general capacity  British pre-teens, teens  middle age women  accept low quality/ low aspirational music  ""classic"" songwriting. It' 'orrible. It seem obvious    people  like Robbie  people  ' particularly like music   much. Folks without collections; folks   never engage   madness one experience  fall   spell  pop music. Angels add nothing -   merely  irritate distraction -  wasp  refuse  go away   summer' afternoon picnic. What  dreadful result. If  vote   -   feel ashamed   -  probably  know  dozen songs   '  -    get  apply  uninformed filter  cast  ridiculous vote. Booo hisss

Angels, best song? You  kidding, right? Last five years I might    accept,  25,  way. Did whoever vote   actually  ANY music knowledge prior , say, 1995? Really quite insult   British music industry   past quarter   century.

No surprise  Robbie Williams consider  list. Where  earth   nominations list come ???? Compiled   eleven year-old girl perhaps?? I mean, Will Young? Come .

What  load  crap, best song   last 25 years - I ' think !! What    REAL artists     last 25 years -  list  endless,  Robbie Williams ' even come close.

What  joke. That song  become   bane    I  develop  Pavlovian response   word 'Angels'  I thrash around,  scream ""    ""  someone tell  "" radio' "". Why  half-baked cheesy ditty like Angels,   become  anthem  millions  romantic sop (think  many time   sing  Pop Idol  example,   ),   vote  best song   past 25 years,  beyond . If    song    others  judged,  musicians may  well give .

Why   reward mediocrity  highly   country?? The initial list   weak anyway,  Angels  best song   last 25 years!!!! I think , I ' realize Radio 2   many listeners   age  10!!

People   short memories! A great song yes,   best   last 25 years? Not  chance. I think  person  oppose   song   vote  .

The Great British Public  work . It'  mediocre, sentimental  safe song. Granted, '   bad, either. But   stand   ANYTHING  The Smiths ( particular ""How Soon  Now?"")  anything   Stone Roses' first album? Nope.

No, Because I'  female  I'  10!

Ok I like Robbie  Angels   decent song. But    way  best song   past 25 years! The shortlist ' great   win    joke!

Predictable  laughable.

The success  Angels   years Brits reflect poorly   state  British music   last 25 years. The British public  brainwash   corporate pulp   presneted    cut edge music  true talent   sadly missed. Whilst Angels   popular song    even  best song  Robbie' repertoire never mind best song   last 25 years.

I   huge Robbie fan  love  song. But I think    lot  outstanding songs / music    influence music today, unfortunately   leave    list.

Have Radio 2 listeners even hear  Joy Division? A band ,  two albums,    bigger impact  music,  continue   ,   last 25 years  Robbie Williams ever .

No doubt  . There'   song   anyone   emotion  feeling. Some people  adopt  slightly snobby stances,  Angels  hit home   far larger audience    song.

It    Joy Division.Those guy  play  influential part  shape modern day music  Angels remain yet another pop song. I sincerely   believe   25 years  ,   influential artists  argue  Robbie Williams inspire  art   way   Byrds,  Beatles  Nick Drake    music today.

Yes!! I think   brilliantly write song  different mean  different people. There   great songs   category...  somebody   win! Robbie   deserve winner.

I  astound    second-rate record  beat   line   amaze songs! '  terrible song, vote    mass  '   brain  appreciate innovative  excite music.

The best song   past 25 years? Really? Come ,   surely  joke? No? I think I need  long lie ...

It  go  show   british public     clue  good quality music   pick Robbie Williams   beautifully talented Kate Bush  Joy Division. I suppose ' confirm one thing -  British public  consistently dull :- &lt;(

No offence Robbie,  pleeease! There must   thousand better songs   formulate cheesy pop song  kids. No one agree    quite frankly    embarassment   integrity  British music,    nail   coffin!

I think Robbie deserve ,      iconic   star     Britain since John Lennon    idol  millions worldwide. Anybody  say  ' deserve   jealous   success. The  real challenger  Queen  hey, Another One Bites  Dust!!

Obviously   Karaoke singers   UK vote  .

If    best song   last 25 years   British Music industry   trouble. Sure Robbie  talented  produce excellent material,      best record.

A sad day  music

It'   type  music I normally like,  even   diehard rock fan, I recognise     good song  appelas   people. That'     vote best song   last 25 years. It'  good -rounder. Just like Robbie.

Best song  25 years? Since 1980? I' confused. ""Angels"" '  bad song. It'  nice, catchy, formulaic anthem  tick   boxes. But    great music. If anything ' regressive. Bland even. I suppose '   evidence   redundant  Brit Awards  become.

Granted angels   good song, however  really '     proper competition. The Queen' song  lackluster,  apart  Kate Bush,   choices  pathetic! Also,  '  Stones , David Bowie, etc,    many greater songs  Angels...I wonder    simply  fact  Robbie ' get  award     make one   !

Best song   last 25 years? What  ridiculuous concept,   even  ridiculous winner. Sigh. On  upside,  least  ' Bohemian Rhapsody,       thankful.

Angels  without doubt  great song  I really ' think  deserve  title  best song  25 years.perhaps  vote      teenage opinion  Robbies' goodlooks   actual song!!! Don' get  wrong, I'  dispute  looks,     deserve winners.

It would    travesty  Angels  . Without Angels, Robbie Williams may well      ,  Britain would   deprive  one    charismatic  talented perform artists. It    see perform live,  125,000 people sing along   fully appreciated. Well  Rob.

I find  hard  believe  'Angels'   best    show   past 25 years! I' rapidly redifining 'best'    head   mean ' gratuitously play  weddings  funerals  people think   deep meaning'. What  Britpop? Blur, Oasis, Suede, Pulp...   make fantastic songs  also make changes,  something different. Why must 'best' always come    commercially popular?

I' nothing  Robbie, I actually like  music,     possibly   best song   last 25year? The Brits  prove   nothing    bargain tool   pop moguls  boost band profile  record sales. The  go   Scissor Sisters, I think    superb record  thoroughly deserve  newcomer award,   album come   near U2' new record, neither      league. Once      baffle discisions made,     artisic reasons,   profit.

No surprise really, ' vote    general public. Since     taste  music?

Personally I find Angels  Robbie Williams   one    irritate songs I  ever heard!

It absolutely deserve  win. It   song   unite  generations   continue   play  many years  come.

It'  absolute joke, however    original 25   poor choices  well. All    pretty pointless exercise !

The song  overplay  oversentimental. Out   rather poor five choices   left,    go  either Joy Division  Queen. I suppose    thankful   ' end    hand  Will Young though.

Although   nostalgia value,    way  deserve  win. Everybody know  word  Bohemian Rhapsody, Nothing Compares 2 U, etc. Much better songs   timeless. Give   someone  real talent.

Although Angels   good song I think  anyone   slightest musical taste  realise      best song   last 25 years. This   another example  record company manipulation  keep  artist   public eye. Why  give   award   greatest pair  trousers  '   means!

"What high-definition    DVDs

First    humble home video,     DVD,   Hollywood  prepare   next revolution  home entertainment - high-definition.

High-definition give incredible, 3D-like picture  surround sound. The DVD disk   gear  play       another year  ,     still  number  issue   sort . But  high-definition film  come    new format DVDs,   profoundly change home entertainment. For Rick Dean, director  business development  digital content company THX,  high-definition future   excite prospect. He  work   Star Wars DVD trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles  Indiana Jones. ""There   time   long ago   film world   video world  two completely separate worlds,""  tell  BBC News website.

""The technology   deal   mean    much conjoined. ""The film   see  theatres  come    digital file   take  home video master,""  says. But currently, put  master feature film onto DVD require severe compression  current DVD technology cannot hold  much  high-definition film demand. ""As much   compress  picture data rate wise,  also take qualities away   picture   fight  hard  keep   master,""  explains. ""I would love   able  show people  project   work  really look like   high-def world  I find   exciting.""

High-definition DVDs  hold   six time  data   DVDs   use . It  take time though  persuade people  spend money  DVD players  buy  different players  display require  watch high-definition DVDs  18 months' time. Mr Dean  confident though: ""I think   see real HD [high-definition],   heavily compress version  ,     remarkable difference. ""I  hear comment  people  say  image pop   screen.""

High-definition  mean  change   work behind  scenes . On  whole, produce film  high-definition DVDs   easier   ways  less compression  needed. Equally,  may mean Hollywood studios ask     put onto  average DVD. ""When  master movies right ,  data rat  run   1.2 gigabits per second,"" say Mr Dean. ""Our DVDs   put  today    squash    five  six megabits per second. ""That'  huge amount  compression     apply -  98%. So    anything  allow  space,  '   compress  hard."" Studios could fit  lot  market material, games,  features, onto high-capacity DVDs. Currently,  entire DVD project  take   three months, say Mr Dean. Although  step  -converting   bypassed,   realistically  save  day' work, say Mr Dean. One    time consume elements  build DVD navigation  menu systems. On  fairly complex Star Wars disks, make sure  menu button work take 45 human hours alone. If studios want  cash    extra space,  could mean extra human hours,   someone   pay. ""If  decision   studio side     go  put  lot    disks,  could   expensive     extra navigation   required."" And  studios  focus  deliver  ""added value content"", think Mr Dean, ultimately  could mean    want  money  . Those cost could filter    price ticket   high-definition DVD. But   consumer     pay  premium price, studios  listen, think Mr Dean.

High-definition throw   challenge  film makers  DVD production alike. More clarity  screen mean film makers   make doubly sure  attention  detail  meticulous. ""When    first HD version  Star Wars Episode I, everybody   sun-tanned,    make-. ""In  HD version  Episode I,   make- line show ,"" explain Mr Dean. The restoration   older Star Wars episodes reveal  interest items .

""There  scan   corridor [  Death Star]  fairly plainly  one   shots,    file cabinet stick behind one   doorways. ""You never use   able  see   things   blur enough   pan    ' see ."" What high-definition revolution ultimately mean    line  home entertainment  cinema worlds  blur. With home theatre systems turn live room  cinemas,  line blur even . It could also mean    get films,    format,  widen. ""In  future   go  look towards file delivery  IP [internet protocol - broadband], give  DVD-like experience   set-top box   hard drive,"" say Mr Dean.

Mr Kilroy-Silk,  recently quit  UK Independence Party, say "" country""   ""stolen  us""  mass immigration. He tell  London news conference  Veritas - Latin  ""truth"" - would avoid  old parties' ""lies  spin"". UKIP leader Roger Knapman say   glad  see  back  Mr Kilroy-Silk.

Mr Kilroy-Silk promise  ""firm  fair"" policy  immigration  say  hop  contest  seat   forthcoming general election. He say Veritas would also announce detail policies  crime, tax, pensions, health  defence   next  weeks. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp say Veritas  join "" already crowd field   right  British politics"". On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk  due  announce  constituency   run    next general election -   come amid speculation    sight set  Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon' Ashfield seat. He  join   new venture  one  UKIP' two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney    Veritas' deputy leader. UKIP' chairman Petrina Holdsworth  say  group     parody   party  men  left.

Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week  months  tension   vie unsuccessfully   leadership   party. He say   ashamed    member   UKIP whose leadership  ""gone AWOL""   great opportunity offer   third place  last June' European elections. ""While UKIP  turn  back   British people, I shall ,""  said. ""I   stand   next general election. I shall  lead  vigorous campaign   cause I believe . ""And, unlike  old parties,  shall  honest, open  straight.""

Mr Hockney also leave UKIP say Mr Kilroy-Silk would ""deliver better""   leader   Eurosceptic party. A spokesman  UKIP call  Mr Hockney  quit  London Assembly. The party assert  Mr Hockney ""  moral obligation,    legal one""  stand . Its leader, Roger Knapman,  say   glad  see  back  Mr Kilroy-Silk. ""He  remarkable ability  influence people , sadly,   [European] election  become clear     interest   Robert Kilroy-Silk Party   UK Independence Party    nice know ,  'goodbye',""  said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk    ""straightforward""  attack  party   want  lead.

Veritas? It'  BNP   expensive suit!

It'  well  good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming,  'Veritas'   party  ' believe  ""lies  spin"",   truth   matter ,  completely useless, due  proportional representation,    chance  'Veritas'    chance  claim power,  change  two-horse race trend. In  opinion     publicity stunt     use   smoke-screen   anti-Islamism slur  get  sack   television.

I think   view regard immigration  share  many. It really  time   UK government cease    paper tiger   issue. In addition   Ashfield constituent I would    interest  Kilroy -Silk oppose Geoff Hoon!!

Good  see  party   right splinter   way  party   leave  always done. Let' hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP   euro-sceptic wing   Tory Party  fade   obscurity      truth   debate  Europe. We benefit enormously   membership   EU,  need     heart  Europe, lead   drive       country want  go,  run away  .

All mouth  trousers. A clown. Trouble ,  vote  collect may  end  help New Labour   third term.

Whatever Kilroy-Silk  UKIP , none   anti-European policies   relevance outside middle England. This new party might gain support  right-wing England,    little impact  Wales  Scotland.

Hopefully    fight within euro-sceptic party  allow   slip    way  get people vote  real political party  address   one issue. England need Europe  survive   soon  people realise   better,  ' rely   USA forever!

At last  impetus  increase  likely 40% turn    election. The electorate  disillusion  British politics. Kilroy  one agenda -  UK -  I'  vote  .

Both UKIP  RK-S  representatives  small-mindedness   lack  vision   whole  humankind. The interest  humanity   world lie  much beyond  scope   people' bicker  ,   overall scheme  things, really care   petty tiff?

Many people believe  Kilroy. You may even believe   switch horse midstream   bad mouth  steed  get  halfway seriously diminish  credibility.

The  idea  political party bear    negative feel  Euroscepticism  British Supremacy  nauseating. One   hope  public recognise  extremists      shun    polls.

I' always think  Kilroy-Silk   self-publicising, egotist   news  absolutely nothing  alter  opinion.

Brilliant,  time  country   plausible party!

Having see  recent BBC 3 documentary  witness  thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour   number  senior UKIP figure I  well understand  Kilroy-Silk feel embarrass   associate   people. Hopefully  UKIP members   interest   political debate  support  action.

Fantastic news. Pro-Europeans   far less  worry    right. The Conservatives   confuse     since  mid-1990s,   extreme anti-Europeans  fracture   splinter group  split  vote  might get  local, European  general elections. Robert Kilroy-Silk' ego  vanity    (  supporters') worst enemy.

As  euro-enthusiast I could    delight  Kilroy-Silk' behaviour. He take  party    build   head  steam,   expose   ridicule  attempt  coup-'etat,    set   serious business  divide   two. The closer  straight---middle  better,  far  I  concerned,    eventuality,  two sceptic party  exhaust  energies fight  .

If every politician  ambition  lead  party resort  form     purpose, '  ballot paper  mile long! You' get  hand   Kilroy-Silk   sheer arrogance  supreme self-belief.

Whilst    great fan  Kilroy I  agree   comment   UKIP leadership,  like  I  also leave UKIP. I believe countless opportunities   lose  discredit  EU   show  people  belong   EU really means. The EU' comment last week  Michael Howard' plan  reform immigration show  little  govern   country    turn round  say immigration   matter   EU   individual member states. The sooner  leave  corrupt super-state  better

Does anyone else think    ironic  Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk  use  Latin name   new party, rather   'good old British' name? Is  indicative   man - contradictory, vain  pompous?

I think Mr Kilroy-Silk  get   good point. British politics  become  PC    result   straight talk honest strong politicians. They   interest    career    people  put   power. As  result I feel  democracy   abuse  I want  stopped. If Mr Kilroy-Silk live   half  promise   get  vote.

Honestly,  really cares? Man  tan leave party   plan,  set  party   idea.

As one  Kilroy-Silk' East Midlands constituents I hope   vote    proud    take    charm vacuity. I feel insult    represent    European Parliament.

UKIP try hard  accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk,   make  clear   control   would satisfy . Someone  keen  complete control  bind  fall foul  UKIP' democratic nature.

Kilroy   able communicator   capable politician,  exactly  way   lead UKIP  . He try  make  work,   ' seem  want  grow . He  leave   position    defend  gaffes   media. This new party seem  logical next step  Kilroy. Good luck   man, I say.

Oh please! This   amuse irrelevance. There  absolutely  chance  either   party communicate  sensible  constructive 'Eurosceptic' argument. They  play  key part  win  country round   idea   reformed,  democratic,  dynamic Europe Union. Future generations  thank    ridiculousness.

The refresh thing  Robert     open, honest  straight. What  politician  claim . I   suspicion   talk   larger part   electorate   critics would like. I shall  vote  .

The electorate   East Midlands vote   Kilroy-Silk    UKIP. Kilroy-Silk  make  MEP    position   UKIP' party list. He   mandate  represent  area   resign   European Parliament.

I ' write  Kilroy-Silk. While '  clown   one man band   moment, '  populist  ' always dangerous.The man clearly   enormous ego  look   current political masters,  seem   one   factor  success.

Good luck  Kilroy though I think     harm  good    new party  UKIP   vote base   strong enough   party   successful    moment UKIP   upper hand  Veritas  start  square one  fight  somewhat uphill battle.

The man I  find cringe worthy  Day time TV, could well turn     country' knight  shin armour. He express view      common amongst society today -  people  almost  scar  express . Kilroy Silk  secure  vote,  many  like . What' , I look forward   day   claim victory, wreck  EU,  rescue  great nation... without  hair   place   tan  perfect  ever!

Great Stuff. The longer  UK dither  Europe,  richer   Ireland become,    English-speaking country fully commit  Europe. Oh  send us   hard-working immigrants -  economy need .

This     Europhiles pray . As  main Eurosceptic party, UKIP  try  resolve  differences  Kilroy  show  unite front  give  UK public  serious political voice  Europe. Having multiple party    view point  split  vote .

Thank goodness  Kilroy-Silk  go -  UKIP  least   chance   election!

It   sad  see  cause  Britain regain  proper relationship  Europe damage   split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could   lot  offer. Instead    split party   damage cause. Under  present electoral system, people must work together,  small party   hope  representation. Last summer, UKIP achieve  major advance, partly   partly due  Kilroy-Silk. It   great shame    dissipate  -fighting.

UKIP   wide platform  policies,   withdrawal   EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignore   comment surround  launch    party. Neither  English Democrats   New Party  interest  let  join   take   leadership speak volumes. Veritas   begin   end  Kilroy-Silk.

If  believe  truth  democracy     two assembly members  resign  force  -elections  stand    platform rather   backdoor approach  politics   elect  one party  defect  another.

So UKIP  good enough    lead,  good enough    follow!

Interesting   party commit  plain speak    Latin name!

Every opinion poll point   overwhelm anti-Europe feel   country. Kilroy-Silk could    verge  something huge    broaden  appeal beyond  one issue. He   extremely able communicator  years  political experience. We want quality schools, top hospitals, clean  efficient public transport, punishments  fit  crime, limit asylum,  purge  bureaucracy  less taxes. It need courage  honesty, two qualities sadly lack   politicians. Kilroy-Silk may     qualities. Recruit  right colleagues, Robert,   time may  come!

Well   cannot get enough limelight   ordinary MP  go   start    Party. It'  flash   real policy 

Let' hope    start   UKIP  Kilroy-Silk slip  obscurity.

"Minimum wage increase  £5.05

The minimum wage  rise  October, benefit   1m people,  government  announced.

Adults must  pay  least £5.05  hour,   £4.85,  18  21 year olds   pay £4.25. The recommendations come   Low Pay Commission  say  number  job  continue  grow since  minimum wage  introduce  1999. Businesses want  frozen, warn  rise could damage competitiveness   unions want  £6 rate.

A  increase   adult rate  £5.35  hour  provisionally schedule  October 2006. According   commission, many businesses  find  last two significant increase   minimum wage ""challenging"". ""We  therefore recommend   slight increase  average earnings,  concentrate    second year  allow business  time  absorb  impact,"" say chairman Adair Turner. The government say      minimum wage  women -  many work  cleaning, catering, shop  hairdressing.

Unveiling  latest increase, Mr Blair say  want  minimum wage  become  ""symbol  decency  fairness"". ""For  long, poverty pay cap  aspiration  prosperity  far  many hard-working families,""  said. ""Too often, people  tell  make  choice   indignity  unemployment   humiliation  poverty pay."" Chancellor Gordon Brown  Transport Secretary Alistair Darling promote  news  Edinburgh, Wales Secretary Peter Hain  Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan  Cardiff  Northern Ireland Minister John Spellar  Belfast. The government   accept  commission' recommendation  21-year-olds   pay   adult rate,  say   look    rate later . Mr Brown said: ""We want   nothing   damage  employment opportunities  young people, particularly young people enter  labour market   first time."" The government  say   look  tougher action   small number  employers  consistently refuse  pay  minimum wage.

The national minimum wage  currently set  £4.85 per hour   age 22  ,   £4.10   age 18  21. A £3 per hour minimum wage  introduce last October  16  17-year-olds,  apprentice  exempt. The Trade Unions Congress welcome  increase,   call   £6 minimum wage  next year. But  Confederation  British Industry (CBI) call   ""pause year""  assess  impact    inflation rise   minimum wage  October. And David Frost, director   British Chambers  Commerce, said: ""The level  increase  year  increase  rat far outstrip  rat  inflation. ""What employers  say  us    '   level  ' start  bite   competitiveness  company right across  country.""

The Liberal Democrats' economics spokesman Vincent Cable say  support  move  raise  minimum wage. ""It'   good   workers    lift    benefit  therefore  good   Exchequer ,""  said. Conservative leader Michael Howard say  accept  principle   minimum wage  would  ""seek  disturb""  increase. Speaking  BBC Radio 4' Woman' Hour, Mr Howard hint  Tories might go   general election   promise  cancel income tax   lowest-paid workers. ""There  people   low salaries,  low incomes indeed  really '  pay income tax,""  said.

It would  better  decrease tax  earn  £12,000  year,  say  tax   £6,000. The losses  tax   recoup    50pc tax band  people make  £100,000. Our minimum wage  go   effectively almost twice  US minimum wage, yet  economy per person   2/3rds   US! Perhaps,    really start question   products cost 50-60%        US. This combine   tax decrease would make  pound  low-paid people  make go much .

It' still  good enough! I get  part time Job  16  I    A-levels   attempt  get  little money save  Uni. This   2 years ago  I  get pay £2.75  hour,  work  hard     older staff, maybe '  time 16 - 21 year olds get  fair wage!

We must remember   minimum wage   part   picture  must  rise   level  make employ people unattractive  encourage businesses  send work  therefore job abroad. Still government  local councils employ staff via  contractors  pay   minimum wage   close  . An easy way   government     preach would   insist  floor pay level   government workers  take tens  thousand  civil servants    social security system  together.

Any increase  certainly welcome news. However    whine   pressure   increase   minimum wage I would simply ask : ""Would   happy  work  less  £5.05  hour?"". Thought  ...  , ' expect others  either.

I ' believe   many   comment    minimum wage! Also I personally take great offence   insinuation  people earn minimum wage  lazy  school  everyone go  university   would serve    supermarkets  clean   ? It'  time   hardworking people  reward     deserve   earn fair pay   bite  respect ' go  miss either. br /&gt;

This  good news. The minimum wage  put  sense  equality back   worker' relationship   employer. Wages  suppose    fair reflection   employee' efforts. For  long wag   point  exploitation -  could  employer get away . In  simplistic term  put  pressure  keep low-paid wag low. With  minimum wage  downward pressure   least partly removed.

It  also interest  read  comment   call business leaders. They   first  defend  right  privilege  board  award fat-cat salaries, bonuses  pension right   select      first  attack policies   put  place  merely defend  right    really make  fat cat purr!

I feel    negative  positives   increase,  one hand  businesses  struggle  stay afloat     hand  today world many young people ' afford  move   property cost  much    earn     able  get   life. Its true many may get complacent   minimum wage could  look      step stone rather   hand .

Here come  usual whine   difficult     businesses! We  remember Michael Howard' protestations   minimum wage would cost  million job    introduce - funny  ' go quiet   one! Jobs  continue  increase since  humane legislation  bring . I think   job  worth   ' worth  pay  fair wage ,  £5.05  hardly  fortune. If  business cannot pay  workers  decent wage  maybe '   run properly    folds,  better-run company  take   duties  employ  people,  everybody win except incompetent business owners!

Great keep   Tony, I remember  despair   80s   low wag employers get away . At last   make  difference  people  reward   working. We ' afford   pay  decent wage. It'   job   price economy, goodbye sweatshops hello decency.

The increase  minimum wage   good thing. Living   southwest  house price  rent  increase hugely (like  rest   country)   past 5 years  make live   average 18-21 years old  difficult. In  south west  increase  live cost    match   increase  pay,  example  job I   Plymouth  underpay   equivalent worker  Exeter  75p  hour. Hopefully  increase   minimum wage  bring   balance pay   regional  national level,   turn allow people like    work hard,  might never earn  6 figure salary  chance  branch    .

I work   large Hospital   contractors provide  ancillary service - domestic, cater & porter etc - pay  minimum wage  £4.85   basic rate. Someone     unglamorous job  earn enough  live decently. How dare people suggest   lazy  complacent  accept  job   wages? Who   think   carry   public service job  contractors  allow  pay  little   consciences allow?

This  definitely  right step   right direction. It show   government care   low income earners  well. This   million vote . Good strategy ' ?

Although I would  deny people  minimum wage increase,  time stinks. I  quite prepare   raft  'bribes'  come   government   election   raft  tax afterwards,   play us   fool  think  .

This  extremely bad news   business - whether   small  medium enterprises  even large companies. By increase overheads,  business,     almost certain rise  cost   consumer    openly welcome  idea   increase   minimum wage    people  still want  buy  shirt,   pair  trainers  next  nothing. The extra cost  increase  bring,    reflect   price   goods  buy, ,  turn   serve  discourage company  setting- business   UK,  encourage  company already base   look elsewhere. The jubilation felt  ""low-paid"" workers   soon give way  misery   lose  jobs.

This   lead   reduction  jobs. Why  many   call centre job go  India. Blair say'  economy  ""strong  stable economy"" however consumer debt   country' debt    highest    heap  onto businesses,     choice   cut  workforce.

The time cannot  coincidental. This  blatant electioneer    expose  .

Andrew  Derby complain  raise  minimum wage  'blatant electioneering'. I ' mind   . In  degrade democracy, elections   one time  elites really   worry   something concrete   majority. My  complaint   paltry figure  discussed. If  maths  right,  35 hour week  £5.05 give   annual income   £9,000  raise   £6 leave   £11,000. The unions   put  Government  pressure  much . Businesses complain might like  take  look  corporate pay, shareholder payouts  profit  wonder  pay  live wage  really  control factor   viability   firm.

I    lift  minimum wage  workers   reasonable level,     accept     come competition  overseas workers. Also small businesses     able  afford  manpower cost. We  already see  sweep change  IT work  lose  India  people  pay much less. It  difficult    understand   five years ago cheap labour abroad  classify  'sweat shop',     tell   global competition. With  manufacture industry  serious decline  country cannot  entirely service industries without something tangible  serve. There    something   top   food chain    manufacturing. The whole picture need   look .

This  great news,   might   I work  minimum wage. Seems  good idea   hopefully   incentive    live  claim  actually get  job. When   ""earn""   claim     work,    incentive. Perhaps  step   right direction.

If  TUC get  way   large number  SMEs    close -   put  people   work. How    government fudge  unemployment figures! The government know    big business  keep  economy go   SMEs   always get overlooked,    take notice   large corporations close  move   countries,     predominantly   foreign companies. We   specialist company    increase  already   effect  us    lose work another one  close us.

While I' delight    low pay   increase   put forward, I  extremely concern   implications  small businesses. As  employee   small nursery, I know  increase  cause great hardship   employer,    unable  increase salaries  higher pay employees   last October' increase   lower pay employees -   originally  pay slightly   minimum      minimum. This latest increase  20p  hour  cause even  financial hardship. If  rate rise  £6  I  foresee many small businesses   pay  employees.

The increase  minimum wage    serious effect   business. Although  pay   minimum level     increase  pay rat  maintain  differential. The raise  well  inflation  without significant increase  sales,   mean  I    take   new member  staff  plan  I   look  reduce  total hours work    members  staff, overtime   first  go.

I currently employ 42 staff whose wag mirror  national minimum wage. Increases  inflation  fine     business  conduct  local authorities    accept  inflation rise   service delivery. 80%   cost  labour. The  aspect   always hide    thresholds  tax credit   move  line   increase     happen   employees tax credit support  reduce   amount   increase, thereby save  government money  increase  financial burden  small  medium businesses

It   good   government  decide  increase  minimum wage -   hopefully motivate people  undertake  ""lower status"" jobs.

I know   great idea - ' bother get qualifications, laze   school,  need   anything   attend   parent ' get fin  remember,    eventually start working, ' matter  lazy  , '  guarantee  decent wage. The ones  suffer   employers.

I hope   industry  business   pay  new rate  Mr Blair  Mr Brown  increase tax allowance  raise national insurance thresholds    treasury ' take    increase   people  say   helping,     another form  stealth tax  business   back door?

I ' believe   minimum wage  ! I think job  create   wage value    people want higher wag   earn . Now,  everyone think  I   ""rich-kid"", I  assure  I  . I come    much work class background  start work 20 years ago   Youth Opportunity Program earn £25 per week. I work hard, go  college part time, get  A-levels  degree & better . I  earn  6 figure salary. I    hard work  get   backside. A minimum wage  make people complacent.

To Ashley,  Swindon:   earn £25 per week,   worth something. These days  £25 would need   near  £60    equivalent buy power. I might add,  thank  successive governments hold   tax allowance threshold  inflation, people earn  minimum wage  pay tax   never would   10 years ago  equivalent wages. ""In  day"" type arguments   view  belong   ' day' - 20 years ago!

As  graduate work  minimum wage, I welcome  increase  pay I  get. I disagree  Ashley, Swindon say I   work harder  get  pay. I   GCSE' A-Levels  A degree   choose  work   small business  ' afford  wag I   getting, I     least 3x  I' get   ' afford . We  work hard   money    . But   plus side I love  job  ' change    get  pay.

As  employer  staff  several shop  last rise   minimum wage cost  company  additional £5000 per year. These next rise  cost  . I   get  money  somewhere  pass    customers. So  one really win   end.

In answer  Emma  Sleaford regard  one really win   end...   contrary Mr Blair win -  win   obviously  announce     vote winner   treasury win    employer   know   amount  tax  national insurance   government  receive    minimum wage increase  rise   course     pay  higher wag    employer higher Employer NI Contributions  well. If  minimum wage increase     hit anywhere near  £6.00 mark    12  people   employment line  one  small business go bankrupt - namely mine. Think  us employers  well Mr Blair,     big corporations earn millions.

All workers   entitle   fair day' pay   fair day' work. How many people   minimum wage   hope  obtain  mortgage  save towards retirement?

It  good news  many Asians live  UK. Students   odd job  increase  income   help  family   home country. I thank Mr. Blair   government  increase   national minimum wage.

I'  really comfortable   word urban. It'  word '  manufacture   country  America  describe black music. The word urban seem  cover   broad range  black music  ' wrong. How far   Brits remove  inner-city music   people  ? It'  far remove  I ' expect   get  bang . The music industry ' champion music   particular genre  well anyway. People ' feel like ' anything    us. I ' feel like urban music'   celebrate  [Joss Stone] win    nominated,    Brits acknowledge  '  urban music scene  '   kick   teeth   end   day. It'  really relevant. If Joss Stone   closest thing   feel comfortable champion     look like    sound   ' sign ,    . It' get nothing    ' really go .



Urban   genre   broad. If  look underneath urban,    number  core elements  include hip-hop, R&B, garage    obviously come soul. Joss Stone   soul artist. Her first album  call The Soul Sessions. So urban    broad brushstroke    umbrella   top  sub-genres,    offshoots    . Joss Stone   amaze success [  US] give  '  UK artist. What  really capture everybody' imagination       17-year-old  Devon   voice  die    bunch  really, really good tune   look good - I think ' '  .

The award  best British urban act  vote   viewers  MTV Base.



I ' think Joss    worthy winner. She make soul music   definitely come   category    describe  urban. The fact  '  Devon   interest thing     music  cover  make  large cities  ' literally rural. The great thing  urban music   '  big range. If    sort  root  black music  dance music  Britain, I think '    call  urban - '   new sub-category,  uber-category,  come . Joss Stone  certainly  old enough       experience   older soul singer,   ' argue     inauthentic   emotions -   come  somewhere genuine. It   come across  real. That'   cut- point     '   way    judge people.



What urban mean  us   organisation   politically correct term  describe music  originate   black background. Music  become inclusive     fight   multi-cultural Britain,     fight  inclusion rather  exclusion. If Joss Stone   accept within  urban music community, I think act   ethnicities  classical music  rock   accept . Race ' make  difference  everyone  included. Out    award dish  yesterday, I' still try  find   people   race receive  sort  recognition  award.



A type  music (especially street music)  originate   city,  typically reflect   characteristic  urban life.

She might   urban,    R&B become  hip hop taint thing   ? R&B stand  Rhythm And Blues, remember!

That Joss Stone  rubbish  certain. If anyone deserve  win  award  urban music (I think probably  include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk  least   rock  pop)  year   Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stake  good claim

She definitely deserve  win  prize, Joss Stone' albums  quite simply amazing, easily better  anything else   release last year. This whole debate    urban,  isnt urban  completely pointless  probably fuel  urban artists  ' nominate  ' win. I cant see  people '  congratulate    talent   .

She  deserve ,  I agree   comment  urban music. Its  stupid phrase,  particularly British. In  state  tend  use hip hop  R&B,  I say hip hop   lot  people   idea  I' talk . Very strange.

What'   name? A rise    name etc... If people want  call  urban,  ? If  really analyse ,  term 'dance music'  mislead   ' describe everything   dance .

Whilst I agree   term 'urban'  open  interpretation,  strike   simply weird  Joss Stone  . 'Urban'     I hear  play  party   inner cities - I live  Brixton   never hear The Soul Sessions pump     bass heavy sound system   party I'  . Good luck  Joss Stone, let' celebrate  victory - let' also question ,  artists  successful  talented  Jamelia, Lemar, Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Alicia Keys  Outkast -  ' see  single black artist  stage collect  award.

So,  ' say    music   black heritage   allow   sing  anyone  ' black. And,   ,   '  acknowledge   even  ' pretty dam good  ? She' 17,   amaze voice,  . Good  . Oh,  '  ""black"" well, let' make  feel real bad   . How dare ! Though hang , '  -called 'public' vote   one?

This idea  pigeonhole whatever  popular   time   different    happen   1940s  50s  relation   ""Jazz"" . The media  call anything    swing beat, syncopate melody  soulful feel ""Jazz"", much   chagrin   artists. It would mean  ""blues"" would  put    mould  ""bebop"", ""cool""  ""ragtime"",   different style   time. Jazz   remain   massively misunderstand term. And    ""Urban"" music? In truth '  lazy term  categorise music   ' really understand. Soul  garage  worlds apart musically (Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam?),   doubt   connections. If   let  music speak     judge  success   artist   number  award ,  maybe   enjoy  music    , rather    represents.

I demand  prize  rural music! Sucks   cities- ' way better  . We  hay,  one thing.

Excluding     become know  urban music would   bad  exclude Lenny Kravitz  Hendrix  rock music   black surely? I dont understand  point  Ty  making. If Lemar,  make music   less soulful  Joss' work ,  might  say nothing. (btw ' black )

How    ""urban""   spend    life   Devon countryside? Nonsense.

I love Joss  bits  ' care   brand  - ' amaze music, full stop. Stop put    bracket  let'  call  music,  let' especially drop  black / urban tag - nearly  music come  black origin,   set  example    ok  pigeonhole people   music   colour.

Surely  point    urban music category  simply  acknowledge artists   make   (historically) consider urban music, irrelevent   colour   skin,    originate . Joss Stone  simply sing  certain type  music    consider urban  style,   someone   inner city,  indeed    USA could sing country music. If  person  good    authentic  sound, would  criticise   refer   country music   artist  represent  style?

The term urban  reference   music genre  UK  developed,  part,   controversy surround  brand   MOBO Awards. The  term 'Music  Black Origin'  confuse  offend many people. This  particularly strange give  existence   Asian Music Awards. It appear   use  'black'  'white'  relation  music make people feel uncomfortable. The term 'urban' therefore,   invoke  sidestep  debate   type  music come first 'black'  'white' thereby render  issue colourblind. The result    redundant new debate    'urban' also means. Perhaps    create  new term altogether  describe  various strain  soul/RnB  Hip-Hop, one    also mean something else -      'Crunk'.

Urban    word ' come  recently  describe ""black"" music ' become popular . The word ' even  use,  common use five  six years ago. It'   way   industry clump   together without   call  black music,   people  oversensitive  might call  racist  .

I'   band    call ""urban"",  I despise  label. I' hate  think I belong   neat market niche,  '   . Ever since  music channel  record comapnies try  fracture   consider 'music  black origin',  label   use  undermine  status  good music   commodity. Look    TV broadcasters, unable  reach young people without condesending,  simply play  'urban' music   soundtrack     dreadful cheap lift music. Ignore  labels,     ,  music.

As  black man, I think I agree     statements  least  statements make   key executives. Black people  lead  music  invent . We  stop call  genre meaningless, northing  meaningless. The real question  would Joss Stone would    successful   music       black? Same thing,  Streets, Amy Winehouse, etc. Who' ever hear  Terri Walker  Rhian Benson.. They   10 time better  Joss Stone      win Urban Music Awards   think Mobos ,    Brits????

So   Joss Stone win  Urban awards. Her music  great soul  surely     'Urban' banner? What  The Streets  ? Would people  whine  Mike Skinner  white... It seem   lot   fuss   race   real issue   music  nothing else.

Urban  PC version  say black music. I'  doubt Ms Stone' talent,   ' Jamelia  Lemar get  Brit? This remind    happen  Craig David  Soul II Soul   past, get nominations  easy  get,  pick   Brit seem    hardest thing.

Refreshing  see people make reasonable, intelligent comment   topic  days. More power  , people! You  say :   music  like  music  ' like -  care  label  put  ?

That entire category   mess. How    people like Dizzee Rascal   Joss Stone? Its like put Eminem  Bob Geldof. She    nominate  Best British R & B act. Joss Stone deserve  win  award   talents,  I ' think    'urban'    sing angels  Robbie Williams.

Urban   nonsense term - music  black origin? Well '  include rock? Music make   inner cities? Well almost  band end  make music  London/Manchester etc. And '  make  weird implication   black people live  cities? It ' make  sense.

Why  music    put   genre? It' music,  like    '. Simple  .

I play   heavy metal band. We  urban music  far  I' concerned. We live  cities  spend  work life   urban environment; It therefore directly shape   write musically.

""Urban"" seem    new name   style  black music. Why  need  rebrand I ' know   name  misleading. Oasis originate   city  characterise  urban life  know, therefore   fit  term ""urban"" yet  '  white rock band  '  describe  .

Joss Stone   fantastic voice  great time  delivery -   reason   need  award   Brit? All  ""urban""    categorisation    red-tape   music business   best ignored.

Yeah,  deserve . She  talented. Urban   crap, meaningless, politically correct  probably actually racist market term though. There'  two kinds  music: good  bad.

Through  cleverly word statement,  club  effectively force Gerrard  publicly make  decision  ,  I think   right thing  .

Critical time  Liverpool  regard  Gerrard. Ideally  would want  secure  future   club   long term. I  hop  ' walk    club like Michael Owen    little cash.

£50m realistically would allow Rafa  completely rebuild  squad, however,    afford    AND keep Gerrard    better  . I would however  happy  Gerrard' transfer   fee  £35m.

Chelsea' win  Fulham - confirm  position   Premiership summit - prove     everything  place  mount serious challenge   front  season.

They  get strength  depth, great players,  outstanding manager  Jose Mourinho  finance   club   world  match. All  need  add    big prize ,    know,    difficult part  . One thing  certain -   put    position  make  leap  success  impressively indeed. They beat   tough Everton  Stamford Bridge, win  Newcastle   Carling Cup,   win 4-1  Fulham,    great result give     show good form. As I said, win  major honour   hardest task  ,   Mourinho    manager   make   whole lot easier  handle  anticipation  expectation   come  way . Mourinho  win  biggest club prize  ,  Champions League,   track record  confidence transmit   top players. It   priceless commodity. No-one   anything   highly-impressed  Mourinho. He  regard   touch arrogant   people,  maybe   appear  way,     silverware  back   talk. Mourinho ' simply talk  good game - ' win   big game    Champions League final  Porto. Some may criticise  talk,   word  back   actions. I' also find     realistic whenever I' hear . He' spend  lot  money   seem   working,    remember lot  managers  spend money     worked. The buy   integrating,   Arjen Robben    player   give   extra dimension.

In  early game   slaughter  defensive tactics,  yet   win games. You cannot win title early    season,    certainly lose    point   board  vital. I also think  criticism   harsh,  even though    score goals   create chance   hatful. Now   take  chances,   double threat  Robben  Damien Duff,  things  look good. I  wonder   lack  predator, particularly  Didier Drogba injured. He  start  look  part    sidelined,     feel  Chelsea   Ruud van Nistelrooy  would  even    safe bet   title. Chelsea also    tool  go far   Champions League. I felt  would never   better chance  last season,    sweep     Europe  far  season. It     interest  see  Mourinho prioritise things,   life   make easier   size  Chelsea' squad. I  say I believe Chelsea would win  league  season, even  Arsenal  fly   start,  I  see nothing  make  change  mind.

If anything,  I  see  confirm  early impressions. And Chelsea would  take encouragement  Arsenal' rocky defensive display  Spurs, even though  run  5-4 winners. Mourinho   say   game, complaining: ""Five-four   hockey score,   football score. ""In  three--three train match,   score reach 5-4 I send  players back   dress room     defend properly. ""So  get  result like    game  11  11  disgraceful.""

On   serious note,    game  merely confirm  importance  Sol Campbell  Arsenal. Much criticism   aim  Pascal Cygan,  I believe  problem lie   absence  Campbell   overall effect  Arsenal' defence. Confidence   crucial factor  defending. When  start concede goals,  suddenly get  chill   bone every time  ball come   penalty area. You think ""oh "" -  find  worst fear confirmed. Arsenal need  reverse  process,   without Campbell,  get  clean sheet   board. But  return  Campbell  key. He solidify  unit,  pace   powerful   air    deck. He  vastly experience    calm influence   around . Campbell pull   together   back  get  defence play   unit. Chelsea    problems  present,    I would still place  money    edge  Arsenal  champion  season.

Well, ' goodbye  another Olympic year   usual   plenty  highs  low  Athens.

Obviously, '  get away   differ fortunes  Kelly Holmes  Paula Radcliffe. But I want  remind      events  make 2004 another year  remember -  forget -  athletics. 

 

One   favourite Olympic moments  Kelly' success   800m.

Winning  race   key   success    win    1500m would   bite   formality. Kelly   full  "" I, ' I?"" thoughts  go   double  Athens. I think  '    800m, '  best event? It   good fun  commentate   1500m    nice   able   part   Athens story. 

 

The victory   British men' 4x100m relay team   bite   surprise   great climax   Games. I think  four   - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish  Mark Lewis-Francis - know deep      best chance   medal. The lads  run poorly   individual sprint  maybe   lift  game   know something  really  stake. 

 

Hicham El Guerrouj' Olympic double   much bigger achievement  Kelly'   global scale.

He   first man since  80 years  win   1500m  5,000m titles. As soon    add  5,000m crown  I  finish commentating, I jump , run   stairs, push everyone   way   give   big hug. He  one    African runners   embrace  tradition   mile   love  hear   Roger Bannister stories. Hicham  someone I enjoy   bite  time , even though  French   English    good. 

 

What happen  Paula  Athens  year   obvious low   personal level    expectations   nation  well. There   set  circumstances around Athens  conspire  produce   dramatic end  I think   greatly misunderstood. Dropping    marathon   right thing    start   10,000m five days later   wise. That   heart    head reacting. Paula   lot  little things go wrong   preparation    day.

Things like niggle injuries,   able     run sessions  feel  pressure   race loom ahead  . I think  come   start line  Athens physically  emotionally drained. And  even  smallest thing ' feel right    prepare  race  marathon, 10 miles   road   hit  like  brick wall. The positive thing  take  Paula' Olympics      learn  lot       lot  people - include . 

 

Purely   race, Paula' victory   New York Marathon   go   one    thrilling. It   nip--tuck    Kenya' Susan Chepkemei   ' usually get  kind  excitement  marathons. It  also  real delight   athletics fan ,  use one   favourite words, Paula show real ""bouncebackability"". And    bite   rarity     I genuinely     inkling   race  go  pan . 

 

Kelly   4x100m boys' victories paper   crack   general performance   British team. We   concern  '  produce enough people   capable  reach finals  senior level.

The  individual men' finalist   track  Michael East   1500m. I  begin  look   wonder    new breed? And '  things begin  look even gloomier  British athletics     win  medals   world junior championships  Italy. Dani Barnes come fourth   1500m     highest finisher  Team GB. The thing    '  athletes get   finals  junior level   really ' look good   Beijing Olympics  beyond. 

 

I tell   I really enjoy  year, Benita Johnson win  world cross country championships back  March. In  absence  Paula,  tend  think   event  something   African preserve. So    Australian come   deliver   surprise  something special. 

 

To  honest, I' get bore    drug scandals, especially Balco. I  wish  whole thing would come   head    move .

"Losing   online gaming

Online role play game  time-consuming,  enthral flight  reality. But   people take  fantasy live  seriously?

When video game World  Warcraft hit  shop  Europe last week fan write    BBC website  express  delight -   offer  warning. ""An addiction   game like   far  costly  time   substance could impair - keep track  time,"" write Travis Anderson,  Texas. Some   comment  humorous: ""This game   good I'  go  get , '  way I could limit  hours I' spend play ,"" write Charles MacIntyre,  England.

But  strike   worry tone   Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): ""'You need  get  ' could   motto   MMORPG. Shame   get  popular,   know  problem   go  mushroom,"" write Stuart Stanton-Davies,  Huddersfield. Scare-mongering article  ""addictive video games""  exist since  days  first game  Pong stop everyone  work   Atari offices.

Gaming  like   pastime -   quickly become  unhealthy obsession, whether   spend  much time   gym,  front   television,  read poetry.

Unfortunately, game  addiction   far  easy association  make. However, stories  gamers spend 10  15 hours  day  front   video game  become  frequent. And  impact      families  quite distress  .

Massively multiplayer online role play game - MMORPGs - allow thousands  gamers  share  common experience  share fantasy  science fiction worlds. The scope   game - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others -  epic,  exploration  adventure  almost infinite. Part   ""problem""  grind -   gamers   perform long-winded, mindless tasks,  bring   level  gain access   adventure. Such open-endedness bring    desire  keep playing;    reason  EverQuest (EQ) nickname EverCrack. E Hayot, write   culture blogzine Print Culture, say recently: ""I use  play  online role-playing game EverQuest  lot. ""By ' lot', I mean probably 15  20 hours  week  average,   weeks  I '   work,  many  30  40 hours.""

He say    world  online game  behaviour ""'  unusual; lot  people I know   game play EQ  much"". ""You lie;  ' go  work   "" stuff    home"";  cancel  refuse invitations  dinner,  spend much less time watch TV ( good thing, presumably),""  wrote, explain  EverQuest take   time. He quit  game,  says,   realise life   fun  EverQuest.

Let us  clear -  obsession  rare. But  huge growth  online game mean  growth   number  people  take  passion   hobby  far. Almost 400,000 people buy  copy  World  Warcraft   first two days  sale earlier  month. Only  fraction  descend  obsessives. The thoughts  families  friends  gamers    affect  EverQuest   find  one blog EverQuest Daily Grind. Jane,  run  website, compile  chronicle  heart-rending stories. ""I  actually convince   point      '' people  spend  time  MMOPRGs   reality,""  said. One unnamed correspondent -   anonymous - wrote: ""On  rare nights   husband  come  bed    time  I , I find  I   use  sleep      difficult  get  sleep  another body lay next  .

""I ' talk      playing. There  absolutely  point   ' hear     distract  I get  'ummm... ya'   minutes  I ask   question.""

""Gaming widows""  become  comedic term  women    shut   male gamers. But        least funny. Another correspondent wrote: ""I believe    addict   online gaming,     cause   depression  restlessness."" And     even sadder: ""Today  son  five days old. ""The sad truth   husband spend 11 hours today play  Warcraft game. He   interact   sweet tiny baby    important quest wait online."" Video game fan often complain   hobby  misunderstand  marginalised. But  game become ever  mainstream,  game ever  immersive,     hide place  social problems.



I wish 30-40 hours  week  unusual  I think  probably '. An 11 hour stretch '  surprise - I' know people  play 15+ hours   stretch. I know  people   spend  week' holiday  work play Warcraft. I know  people  would play Ever[Crack]  shifts...waking  3am  take    friends  resume wait   item  'needed'  appear. I understand   key sign   addiction    alter  life around  rather  fit    life. By  standards many  us  addicts. So   solution  force   stop playing..    need  make real life  bite  interesting?

Sadly    talk  people become obsess  gaming, I find  long    time  join . I     long term relationship   4 years - since  began, game  become    complex. And     I find I  less  less time  play ,   marriage  work   main drag   time.

I think  line  play  game  lot   game addiction  really quite distinct. I play game  lot, definately  20 hours  week,  I ' go miss work   commitments  order  play games.

I ,   year ago, delete every game   computer. RPGs   worst -  real world fade    worry sorround  new magic staff  mighty sword. Unlike books,  perhaps even TV,  gain absolutely nothing. When  stop play '    point    started;   achievements   10 hour session  irretrievably lock   game , since ' gain nothing   real world,  may  well pile   achievement   fake one.

Despite  little monetary value,  ""rewards""  encouragement offer   MMORPGs  enough  hook game  hours daily. If  business could learn  leverage   simply human need  easily measurable progress  recognition. Perhaps  unhealthily obsess simply need  recognition   achievements  reality?

My advice  game widow  ""  ' beat 'em, join 'em"". That , try play  . If  want  play  well, well  least '  together somewhere...

I   addict   cost   relationship. I still play ,  without  guilt , hehe, How long   play  one sitting? From morning till  early hours   next day,  bird  sing  side     hobble   bath room cos  bladder   full    pain,  would hardly eat, perhaps  toast, smoke endlessly  drink. Now, thankfully  fascination  wear   I   girlfriend  still  job. For   part online game give   adiction  illusory achievement,      end  sight  keep go   mirage   ultimate.

Obsessive behaviour ,  course, always cause  concern,   always bother   article  game talk  term  ""reality"". Obviously, somebody  spend thirty hours  week play EverQuest   problem. This problem, however,  nothing     dysfunctional sense  reality. An obsessive EQ player   consider  game   ""real""    -  example -  obsessive automotive tinkerer consider  car   human. If MMORPGs   unique danger,  term  encourage obsessive behaviour,      create  absorb virtual world,  rather     easily access 24/7. The problem    lie   nature  gaming,    nature  modern 24 hour culture.

The problem    call MMORPGS     never really complete , ' always another quest  . A    friends     10 hours sleep since   release friday...

Championship Manager consume  life  years. One particular session start   2pm   Sunday, pause   brief sleep  5am   Monday   visit  University  class restart   midday  another 10 hour session. The people  tend  hark     problems  ""hardcore gaming"" seem      rarely allow   become immerse   game. I would expect  perspective  change      .

I use    EverQuest addict  I   college. It come   point   game world felt  real   real one. I fail alot   course   able  barely graduate. I  lucky  I come   sense  I , others  less fortunate  drop   college. Now  I  hold  job, I avoid online RPGS like  plague.

When I  make redundant I tell  partner I   new job  three months whilst every day I play EverQuest  7:30am till 5:pm. When She come home I pretend I   get   well, hence justify play   evening. I  since quit play MMORPG    good job.

When I get   point  I  eat  dinner  front   PC I realise things  get silly  I' try   spend  much time  . It'  easy. I feel   I' get  real addiction go  .

For   problem   I love  complete  goal. Once   complete   , I  finished, time  move . I become obsess  complete  goal,    standpoint    addiction. In  game    never complete  ""ultimate"" goal, well  would  like fall   black pit. It  easier  escape   control fantasy world  face reality  time -   word  goal offer   PC game  ""easier""   fun   real world. Pretty scary implications   think  .

I ' buy World  Warcraft   would destroy  marrage, I  know !!

I play Star Wars Galaxies    year   attest   addictiveness   games. They   engineer    way  early    game  progress quickly,   progress become exponentially slower, require    time  reach  next level. I' sad  say    peak   addiction I  spend entire weekend  front   monitor, slowly build   character, stop   food  toilet breaks. Thankfully I make  clean break,  actually manage  sell  Jedi account  £800 -     sanity check   otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum.

Seven years ago, I begin play Ultima Online. This game dominate 2 years   life. They  2 wonderful years  I still  vivid memories   experience  friends I . Online game    world  escapism      without fear   thoughts  others. Something  cannot always  achieve   day  day run   normal life. Whilst I would warn  people give  much   life   games, I believe    better way  spend  time  say watch TV.

Gaming  addictive    make  recognise addiction. When I  single I use  play upto eight hours  night  work every night    year, build   stats, complete evermore quest  battle ogres. But somehow I find time  get , even meet someone  get married! Has  life changed? Hell ! I still cast spell  battle till  early hours   morning. On   fun!

Online game   enjoy   much   would enjoy watch television,  go   cinema   pub   mates.

Many people use recreational drug   occasional basis   able  lead succesfull live  families, relationships  good careers. A minority allow drug  take   destroy  live  become addicted. According   article    true  MMORPGs. The message   government  clear, either legalise drugs,  outlaw online gaming!!

Sounds like    sad stories  -  I  believe  . I play alot  Warcraft ,  know full well  addictive  . I  resolute     take   life. It certainly get   way though. I think   people simply   know   draw  line,  lack  willpower  stop  step  .

I think I' obsess  game  general, I spend far  much time play game like Everquest 2  Football Manager rather  go   interact  real people   I  try , I' always think   back   mind  I' rather   front   computer win  league  Cambridge United.

I  obsess  online role play games. It'   much quest     adrenaline   real life situation - goals  achieve etc. I spend  five hours per day online play   I rarely get   four  five hours sleep  get   work  next morning...

As many   players spend  time  MMORPGs rather   front   TV I fail  see    affect players social live negatively. Furthermore  type  game contain  huge social aspect, whereas  game    pursuits (    couch potato)  players could  indulge   solitary  nature.

These game  like  things --  much  anything   bad thing,   long    walk away   computer    things ,    great fun.

Living  Korea   moment,   lot PC Bangs (Internet Cafes). Nearly   South Koreans  addict  online games,  one Korean die    lack  food  water    play online games.

I play xbox live every day. I find  self lie  reschedule everything around  game fix. The longest I play   24 hour straight session. I know I play   long  '  obsession  I ' control. Can  reccomend  counsellor -     wind ...  something I' increasingly concern ...

Me   mate play online   hour  two  day, '  aware   much time  disappear  sit  front   TV, try  'frag'  individual. It' get  balance  get home  relasing  stress   day   hour   gaming,  enjoy 'real' life...

I buy  US version  World  Warcraft   come . The longest period I play  23 hrs straight. I give   game   month     addictive,   subsequently  buy  European version (' help ). In future, I' go  regulate  time far  strictly. Great game!

Having play MMORPG game   years I agree   type  game   life sucking. But  concern    younger generation  gamers  play  hours  end   adult enviroment. Most MMORPG game  need  credit card  play  I dont think parent know     let  children .

Unless   undeniable medical proof  star   computer screen  hours   time  damage  person&#191; health,   expect    decline   get worse.

These people  pathetic. They need  get   machine  notice   world   swiftly overcome  issue  trouble  make  trifle worry   ""online universe"" absolutely meaningless.

After use     I     tempt  get rid   SonyEricsson P800 smart phone. That   relatively large screen, even      slower GPRS access   network.

But Europe' gamers may   early adopters  drive demand. Europeans    wait   least 2006   see mainstream HDTV.

To view ,  need   transmit  HD format,  people need special receivers  display   handle  high-quality resolution. The next generation  consoles, however,  expect  start appear   end  2005, start  2006. And  new computer display  plasma set  already capable  handle  high-resolution pictures. ""In  next generation [ consoles] HD support  mandatory,"" Dr Mark Tuffy game systems director  digital content firm THX tell  BBC News website. ""Every game  go   playable  HD. ""So consumers   go   spend   money  HDTVs,     content  watch,  go   blow away   really high-detail pictures. ""It' go  change really  way  look  gaming.""

At  end  last year, Chris Deering, Sony' European president, make  prediction  20 million European households would  HDTV set  2008. A previous prediction  analysts Datamonitor put  figure  4.6 million  2008,  increase   estimate 50,000 set   end  2003.

Demographics  change    ""sweet spot""   game industry   gamer     late 20s.

Higher capacity storage discs,   HD-DVD  blue-ray ,  set   standard   next round  game console - allow developers  room  detail graphics.

For console developers though, HD offer  production changes. It could make game production slightly  expensive, think Dr Tuffy. ""But  may see  cross-platform development  game become  common     easily  able  take  PC game  apply    console,""  says. ""You  literally go  get   point,   Lord   Rings game  example,  go   closer  closer   actual film, especially  CGI stuff   DVD.

"Terror power expose 'tyranny'

The Lord Chancellor  defend government plan  introduce control order  keep foreign  British terrorist suspect  house arrest,   ' enough evidence  put   trial.

Lord Falconer insist   proposals   equate   police state  strike  balance  protect  public   threat  terrorism  uphold civil liberties. But thriller writer Frederick Forsyth tell BBC News   personal response   move.



There   mortal danger aim   heart  Britain. Or  say Home Secretary Charles Clarke. My reaction? So ? It    I  cynical     care. I care   country  much.

But   66 years  I   alive,     one hour,  one day,  one month,  one year,       threat aim  us. My point ,  British  always cop without become  dictatorship. We  cop  fear without become  state base  fear;   cop  threat without turn  country   land  state threat. But     Blair government  seek   - create  tyranny  defend us   al-Qaeda tyranny.

I  bear  25 August, 1938. The mortal threat back    scruffy little Austrian call Adolf Hitler. A week   first birthday,  threat  become reality. We   war. My father wear  uniform  five years. After 1945  yearn  peace  last. But  1946 Winston Churchill tell us -   Baltic   Adriatic  Iron Curtain  descend across Europe. Behind  Iron Curtain, another genocidal psychopath, another threat. Josef Stalin trigger  Cold War,   Berlin blockade  1948. My whole generation  blight  .

We  threaten   nuclear holocaust,  nuclear wind,  nuclear winter. We build shelter  would  shelter nothing. We spend  treasure  weapons instead  hospitals. We take silly precautions. Some fight ;  march futilely  . Some pretend    . The Cold War last 43 years,   remain  parliamentary democracy. By  early seventies   terrorism  well. Al Fatah, Black September, Red Brigades,      us  IRA   INLA. Thirty  years; 300 policemen  women,  600 soldiers,   3,000 civilians dead,   win  even IRA bomb could  force us  become  tyranny. That    tyrants lost. Civil right  infringe  little  humanly possible. Evidence    take  secret  protect covert sources; yes ,  one judge, -jury court    institute  juries  terrorised. Informants    give immunity    crimes  win  bigger battle. But habeas corpus   die; right  appeal   abolished. Now  threat  Islamic fundamentalism. Its leaders want  destroy  society;    IRA.

It  base  fund abroad;    IRA. It  sleeper fanatics inside  society;    IRA. It  extremely hard  penetrate   agents;    IRA. The prime movers   easy  bring  trial; neither   IRA. But  . And without become  tyranny. Now  Blair government propose  law system  fascism  communism. The citizen   arrest  hold without charge  trial,  even   careful consideration   experience judge,   whim   political activist call  government minister. To  protect  terror  government says,  must become  tyranny. But  tyranny  base   citizen' terror. This   victory;   defeat   shoot  fired.

An interest article -  good  see widen participation   debate -  I suggest  move one step . Our  bomb  bullets    shatter peace,  invade foreign nations, imprison  innocent  'hunting'   'shadows' cannot destroy  evil   mind,  hatred within  heart. Rather  focus upon effect,   consider  cause,  terrorism   begin  bombs. Why  try  foreign policy  compassion,    enhance  democracy,  share  freedom.

I agree  Frederick Forsyth. We really ' deal  terrorism  turn Britain   fascist state. What  really need   honesty   security service   politicians. If     evidence  bring  people  trial,  probably ' . Our security services, behave like  detective   decide   certain person  guilty, rake   kinds  obscure  flimsy evidence  try  prove ,   real villain get away. Remember    WMD  Iraq. Just   person may  make  stupid  naive decisions  life   make   terrorist.

In  overly 'politically correct' society,   good  see someone like Mr. Forsyth speak . Yes,    oppression   British government   past,  overstep  mark  place like Ireland,  yes,   still  democracy    rare   arrest without charge/trial etc. (apart   number  prisoners  Belmarsh goal,  example).This country sign   human rights,   pretend    apply   people  nothing  fear,  innocent people (defined  ?). When ID card become mandatory,  data collect    protect   Data Protection Act,    readily available  people like GCHQ,   control   person whose ID   checked.

The threat   new. You cannot compare  threats  past years  . Forsyth say 3000 die  30 years  terrorism; 3000 people die  one morning  NY  September 11th 2001. The threat today   terrorists  acquire nuclear  biological technology. A Kilo  Semtex  flatten  building,  Kilo  plutonium  flatten  city. You    combination  people   perform terrorist act  technology   rapidly become accessible. I agree,  government  probably encourage  degree  mass-hysteria  talk   threat;  talking-  threat   nothing  unacceptable .

The problem   issue     ' important,   fact   general  Brits    politically apathetic  times,     let  go without tell  government . However,   nation  give  world  common law   true sense   right  individual liberty I hope   prove   one step  far.

As somebody  Chinese origin, I  say   country use    good place  migrate  start  new life. Whilst life ' perfect,  could make better  . Now   riddle  red tape   tell     cannot . We    politically-correct     allow   beliefs  opinions. We   Prime Minister  spend  much time meddle  US politics  affairs   little     live  British Citizens  home  abroad. Mr Forsyth    good job  voice  opinions. Let' hope  BBC ' get gag  let people express  views. The people   right  know   BBC' role   Inform, Educate  Entertain...

I agree. Terrorists intend  spread fear   reality    government   spread  fear,   constant publicise    invisible enemy  dangerous   must allow   ride roughshod   right  liberties. In  end,   thing  seek  protect     give    name  safety   invisible enemy. The terrorists  already .

I absolutely agree  Frederick Forsyth. Yes    defend   terrorism  exist laws seem     adequate. The idea   ""new terrorism"" demand new power  erroneous. The evidence   real terrorist capability   UK  scant. Ricin,  example,   dangerous poison      weapon  mass destruction. What  really worry   enthusiasm  Mr Blair   government  authoritarian reactions  attempt  manipulate  electorate  fear.

If  government   way  ID cards, track     totalitarianism  win      matter little whether  give    terrorists demand  . We   lose  precious freedom  Bush  Blair constantly tell us      seek  bring  others.

I agree wholeheartedly  Mr Forsyth. I  shock   ease    government  prepare  wipe   major portion   liberties  British people  enjoy  centuries -  right    deprive   liberty without  trial  open court. That go right back  Magna Carta,  ordinary people  spill  blood  enforce  right  governments  think  ""knew best"".

When  look  today' Britain,  realise George Orwell   wrong  one thing:  date.

Frederick Forsyth put  beautifully. The government  seek  introduce  police state. The new power  home internment without trial follow  pattern  include  introduction  surveillance via compulsory ID card   link  data bases, together   un-British idea      swear allegiance   state   age  18 years. We  sleep-walking  . Wake !

An interest view  miss two crucial facts   new threat: 1) If  terrorists acquire weapons  mass destruction  WILL use  without fear  Mutually Assured Destruction  keep  cold war   state  tense balance. These people  use devastate force  us without fear  ANY consequence. 2) The terrorists  prepare  use suicide bombers  mean  could kill innocent people   London Underground   could   little  stop . Because  terrorists  potentially SO deadly,    come   new, tougher responses. It    little late   day  people outside London wake  one morning  find   London   nuked. We '  much   society leave  debate !

He' correct      says. Mind    seem   forget  disgraceful internment policy  Northern Ireland  probably cause many idealistic  misguide young Catholics  join  IRA. Administrative detention  Muslims could   similar effect .

Surely   public would  better protect   security services, rather  alert  suspect terrorist  place   house arrest (   long?)They   place suspect terrorist  surveillance  maybe acquire sufficient evidence  prosecute  even better prevent  terrorist attack.

I ' usually  much time  Mr Forsyth' largely right wing view   time   get  spot . There   doubt    terrorist organisations  would like   harm   U.K.     doubtful whether al-Qaeda   global organisation coordinate . The rise  surveillance cameras, ID cards,  plan  charge  road use  track every vehicle   times,    stuff  nightmares. Add    new legislation  effectively mean   protection   law   remove  anyone   whim   Home Secretary,  I genuinely wonder  sort  world  two children  inherit. Where   end. As  stand terrorists   need  attack  U.K. ' government  soon  ' people terrorise    could  achieve    bombs.

Mr Forsyth  express exactly   gut fear  reservations    propose legislation,  could  verbalise. Thank .

Mr Forsyth seem  forget  kill   Troubles occur   side   religious divide   carry   killers   sides. He also forget basic Human Rights  suspend   . Experienced Judges sit     greatest miscarriages  justice   times. For  little return  maximum alienation. These laws   emphasis   Islamic threat     .

Forsyth  wrong. The nature   current threat  new. It   longer   arm forces,   Soviet threat   Eastern bloc . It     I. The terrorist aim  kill indiscriminately. The best comparison  therefore  blitz, 1941. At  time, let us  forget, suspect (foreign  British  routinely round   intern   duration   war, without  complaints   public. We must  forget    war.

I' say    likelihood   attack   sleeper cell  fundamentalist lunatics   major UK target   ""When""   ""If"" probability. I' bet  money  like   day    attack Freddie Forsyth   say   government '  enough  protect  UK. People like Forsyth   see one side   argument       side   opposite New Labour  Tony Blair.

I agree wholeheartedly  Mr Forsyth. The  reason  country     wonderful place  live,   attack,   terrorists,    government. The perpetuation   perceive terrorist threat       'alleged' terrorists  ,     government. I believe   government  , ,    least, highly questionable   worst, sinister. At  point   feel   enough control  every single person   British Isles;     tag  monitor constantly? Our freedom   craftily  surreptitiously whittle away   government    gain nothing. It    great concern  everyone.

I  slightly older  Mr Forsyth  therefore  live    history  . I    police state  would  like  think  I live  one. I think   attack  Iraq make  international situation worse  may  provoke  act  terrorism.

How true. There  extremely worry parallel  Britain   Germany   30'. I never think  would   easy  take   country  within.

Mr Forsyth  forget one key point;  terrorists  threaten Britain today  well aware  Hitler, Stalin,   IRA  failed. As  result modern day terrorists     things  predecessors  . That   mean   civil liberties  modern Britain must  erode  counter  threat;   always   absolute last resort. But  meet  new threat,  defeat  sinister fanaticism  today' terrorists,  may need   things  little differently. Let us hope .

Frederic Forsythe' comment seem      well-thought- analysis    (human society   whole,  Britain  particular)  resist  temptation  -protect  fear. It   fear  enable terrorists  succeed   end,  terrorists  come   forms,  Mr. Forsythe' open comment suggest.

I  remind   quote attribute  Thomas Jefferson. ""A nation  limit freedom   name  security   neither.""

The government  face   incredibly difficult task,   make  policy  deal  . It'   well criticise  policy,   Mr Forsythe ' draw   years  experience  offer  alternative, I say 'So ?'   opinions.

Frederick Forsyth' rhetoric  absurd   conclusions laughable. He distort reality  serve   prejudice  New Labour. This government seek  balance protection   democracy  minimum loss  civil rights. It  Frederick Forsyth    extremist,     appreciate  need  balance.

I rarely find  agree  My Forsyth,    instance I think   correct. The rule  law must prevail, civil liberties  worth defending. If  government  hold 'suspects' without charge  trial, ' next?

I agree absolutely. By introduce fascist type laws  loose  moral high grind   fight  terror. Our democratic system   perfect,   Churchill point    ""better    others    tried"". Terrorist attack  take place   many reason   take  personal risk  return  personal freedom.

I   usually agree  Mr. Forsyth,    spot  . The single biggest threat  face     government dedicate  act illegally  manipulate international  national law  suit   purpose. Totalitarianism always require  outside threat, justify  range  extraordinary power leaders want. The British government   far greater threat   terrorist organisation.

Although,  principle I agree  , Frederick Forsyth fail  address one key point- al-Qaeda attack (though obviously    none yet   UK) seek  kill  maximum number  people. The IRA want  limit  death toll   attack    maintain support among  republican movement.

Yes, I agree  Mr. Forsyth' views. I   believe  government' plan  justified. There   reaction    negative influence   US President' interpretation  democracy  freedom. He use   arguments   current   WWII,  Wars  ""liberate"" Iraq, Afghanistan  Syria  Iran  come. We  leave  poor inheritance   future generations.

Mr Forsyth   wonderful writer   keep  fiction   belongs. The British Government   go   road  Mr Forsyth suggests. Sadly comment     make  lot  people believe    govern  people   fast become tyrants instead   genuinely commit  stop tyranny, even   method employ       moment alien   British people   live   democracy protect  Tony Blair  others  like mind , Mr. Forsyth seem   put along side  'scruffy little Austrian.'

Thomas Hobbes would  smile   grave  Labour' propositions. Like New Labour,  call   libertarian. Like New Labour,  believe   promote  people' best interests. But  Forsythe criticise  government, Hobbes   criticise   subsequent philosophers  argue  way   hand   totalitarians. Simply put,  argue   favour   ultimate liberty -  liberty  live - man   prepare  surrender   liberties   supreme sovereign,  protection   fellow, barbaric, man. Hobbes   roundly condemn  posterity,  rightly . I hope New Labour suffer   treatment.

I agree  Mr Forsyth' views. The governments approach  totally   spirit  British democracy. They must   allow  get away  .

Of course Frederick  wrong  Britain win  war   IRA  ' wrong    country  become  tyranny. Has  forget  shoot  kill, torture, internment without trial, collusion  loyalist death squads etc?

My background  somewhat similar  Freddie'  I  persuade  agree  many   sentiments. We    moral justification  impose  system  government  anyone    systematically deprive   citizens  basic individual  collective freedoms.

Whilst  principle  keep potential terrorists  house arrest might seem superficially attractive,  , unfortunately, also  first step towards totalitarianism. Who   decide    suspect? Why   believe ? Who   faith   honesty, integrity,  competence   intelligence service  politicians  light   events  recent years? What   stop false denunciations? What   falsely accuse   lose  careers? Who  support  families? Will  children still go  school? It smack     methods  Nazi Germany, Stalin' Russia, Ceausescu' Romania -  list go . It look    new dark age  coming.

I see  opinion  Mr Forsyth' remark  divided. The problem I see     support imprisonment without trial believe   never happen     family,   people  ' like   scar . But history  show     laws like ,  always get abuse    power. After , today  may  scar    people    power  someday   power may  scar  ! And  day, '   one imprison without  chance  justice. Our laws     cannot   imprison   whim   police forces,     show   deserve  . If  imprison people without trial   indeterminate period,    better     fighting.

I never think  possible    agree   single word utter  Frederick Forsyth,  I'  wholehearted agreement     one. We,   nation   grave danger   dupe  pro US propaganda,   course also mean ' inherit ,      total paranoia,  allow  governments,   political persuasion incidentally,  gradually,  insidiously, impose  police state  well try & test back door methods. I grieve   future   children, '  wonder ' adamant  ' ever want    .

This government,  much fanfare, sign us    European Convention  Human Rights   want  introduce indefinite house arrest without trial. This put    par   government  Burma.

Like many   respondents, I ' usually think  Mr Forsyth  someone whose view I share,    instance  oppose Charles Clark' proposals  house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly  Mr Forsyth/

I agree  Mr Forsyth. Just look   facts -  government (along   US) invade another sovereign country (Iraq)  select intelligence  back ' case base  fear. The facts turn     different. If individuals  treat    distort way,  '    damage   terrorist organisation could  bombs. We become animals .

I agree  many ways   Mr Forsyth  say -      respect   influence within  world  must  see   walk  walk  well  talk  talk -    accuse countries   Zimbabwe  Burma  human right abuse    lock  people  may  totally innocent,   hypocrisy   highest order. Mr Forsyth link ""Islamic fundamentalism""   new ""threat"". However  appear    misunderstand  term ""Islamic fundamentalism"". It   point    Muslim  adhere   true fundamentals   Qur'aan   teach   last Prophet Muhammad   Islamic Fundamentalist. This person   commit suicide   shape  form,   / kill innocent women, men  children. This person  self-reflective  constantly try  better / action   good  others. The people  Mr Forsyth label  new ""threat""      follow  correct teach  Islam. They  arrive    interpretations  assumptions  regard  actions. On top  ,  claim   follow Islam   true form!

I accept   intentions   policies   make Britain  safer place  I cannot think   single example  history    sort  thing  ever make  difference -  Northern Ireland internment certainly ' achieve anything -  bomb ' stop,   could  argue    achieve    supply  IRA  yet  angry  resentful republicans   take  arm   British.

Being eight years older  Frederick Forsyth   survivor   Blitz  London,   easy  agree  ,   absolutely spot . During  IRA bomb   massive explosions  Canary Wharf,   right   I write ,  also   leave   City  London. Notwithstanding    attempt  nearly successful assassination attempt  Prime Minister Thatcher  Brighton   later occupants  10 Downing Street,    retaliatory blitz  Belfast  Dublin      Afghanistan  Iraq. Even  England   true peril  1940 apart   detentions    wholesale derogation  habeas corpus   like. We   see   latest attempt   liberties include ID cards,  Winston Churchill decide   go since,  said,  average Bobby   beat could   rely     tempt  take undue advantage   citizen go   lawful activities (incidentally I  still remember  old ID card number). Hence   clear   far  great police state power set   statute book    resist  neutered.

What  I add  Mr. Forsyth' eloquently put arguments... except applause! Well   man  stand    count   ""war  tyranny"".

"Wales 'must learn health lessons'

The new health minister  Wales say   lessons  learn  England  tackle wait lists.

Dr Brian Gibbons,   first full day   job  Jane Hutt  sacked, admit ""big challenges""  insist  ""essentials""   place. But  Plaid Cymru   Liberal Democrats say Dr Gibbons need  change policy. Meanwhile Ms Hutt defend  record, say wait time  list  "" 10%   health agenda. Dr Gibbons,    GP  Blaengwynfi,   Upper Afan Valley,  become AM  Aberavon, say NHS staff want  period  consolidation  ""tremendous change  reform"". One   biggest problems   face Ms Hutt   five---half years   assembly' first health minister   length  wait list  Wales.

But  say  NHS  Wales also need  create  healthier population rather  respond   ill health,   balance view  priorities  important. ""We  need  consistent across--board approach, recognise  patients' experience    use  service  go  ,   end   day,  main test    service  working.""

"What price  'trusted PC security'?

You   buy ""trusted computers"",    really trust  PC vendors, ask technology analyst Bill Thompson.

If   recently buy  IBM ThinkVantage computer,  Dell Optiplex,  one   whole range  laptops  Toshiba, HP/Compaq  Samsung   may  get    money   realised. Inside  shiny new PC   extra chip call  trust platform module (TPM)    use   range  hardware-based security features. Eventually  TPM   build   main processor ,    trust compute group   way    find one  every piece  hardware  ,  mobile phone  TV set top box  children' toys. But   moment    separate piece  hardware, provide enhance security feature  program  know   use . And  part   well-designed network system,   provide  lot  security   enjoy today. A big advantage   TPM     hardware-based.

At  moment   us rely  software  keep  information safe  secure. It might  password-protected user accounts, data encryption program   firewall,    rely  program code run   inherently insecure processor.

Hardware security  less common, even     lot safer. This  partly     expensive  give someone  smartcard   password,  also    work  users, systems administrators  managers. As  result  settle  second best. So   come  computer security, trust systems could   major step forward. After ,     laptop    run program    digitally sign      lot harder  virus writers  get  malicious code  run. And    file  lock automatically  even   get  computer steal  personal data   safeguarded. At  moment support  trust hardware   build  major operate systems. Instead    use special software, like HP' ProtectTools  Wave Systems' Embassy. This provide file encryption, password management  identity protection, usually  business users  connect  company networks. Full support   trust compute specification    available  Microsoft   next release  Windows, ""Longhorn"". This  include  Microsoft,   typical act  obscurantism, call  ""Next Generation Secure Computing Base"",    give user-level program access   trust compute hardware. When  happen   expect  see  lot  publicity around  new capabilities,   doubt  Windows security centre  encourage users  turn   trust compute capability    turn   firewall. However    downside   increase security  viruses, spyware  data theft    provide.

Because  trust compute base  also use  make digital right management (DRM) systems  secure,   give content providers  lot  control       music, movies  book    buy  . We  see recently  allow digital right management service   live  lead  unwelcome consequences. Users  Apple' iTunes use   able  stream  music   bring    five  iTunes users,  great way  let  mat discover  music collection.

But  latest version  iTunes limit  capability,    earlier upgrade reduce  number  time  could burn  select playlist  purchase songs   CD. Another take away  ability  play songs download  Real' Harmony service   iPod. Apple      write  software   control  right management. Once   embed  trust hardware    even harder  dedicate programmers  find  way around  restrictions  give us back  fair use right    guarantee  copyright law. Similarly, users  TiVo digital video recorders  find   cannot record  shows,   program    record  automatically delete   day. This happen   change  TiVo  make   software,   users cannot control . One wonder whether hardware-based DRM  work    believe  locking- digital content   bad idea,    flexibility  copyright law  something    embrace   take away. It   work    fundamental flaw   heart   system:  order   purchaser  view  content     unlocked. Once   unlock  someone, somewhere,  figure   way  make  copy   unlock version. And   unlock version leak onto  network    uncontrollable. The efforts go  DRM would  much better spend build efficient distribution services, find business model   base  trust  customers,  offer high quality download  fair prices. What  want    much  trust compute platform   trust customer platform. The record company   film industry need  recognise    us,    time,  pay  reasonable amount  good quality material. They  benefit   build  market   I  share songs   friends, record show I want  watch later,  burn CDs   kids;  market  respect  spirit  copyright law    seek  replace   restrictive contract  end user agreements. We need  ensure  trust compute remain   control   users    use  take away  freedoms  enjoy today.
