Each participant genuinely want  row  stop,  think  worth prolong  argument   tiny bite  ensure  view  heard. Their successive attempt  end  argument   last word ensure  argument go     . (In  case  Mr Blair  Mr Brown, successive book  published, ensure  issue never die.) Now  '   participants  stupid - ' actually  individual behave entirely rationally, give  incentives face . Indeed, ' even  piece  economic theory  explain  . Nothing  obscure  ""post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory""   chancellor   quote -   ubiquitous piece  game theory   respectable policy wonks  familiar .

It' often refer    ""prisoner' dilemma"", base   parable much tell  economics degree courses...   sheriff  two prisoners. The story go  two prisoners  jointly charge   heinous crime,   lock   separate cells. But  sheriff desperately need  confession   least one  ,  provide enough evidence  convict    crime. Without  confession,  prisoners  get  minimal sentence   trump  charge.

Clearly  prisoners' best strategy   keep  mouth shut,  take  short sentence,   clever sheriff   idea  induce   talk. He tell  prisoner separately,    confess -      one  confess - '  let   crime. And  tell     ' confess -      one   confess - ' get life. Now,    prisoner confront   choice,  best bet   confess. If  partner ' confess, ' get  completely.

But  high-definition film  come    new format DVDs,   profoundly change home entertainment. For Rick Dean, director  business development  digital content company THX,  high-definition future   excite prospect. He  work   Star Wars DVD trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles  Indiana Jones. ""There   time   long ago   film world   video world  two completely separate worlds,""  tell  BBC News website.

""The technology   deal   mean    much conjoined. ""The film   see  theatres  come    digital file   take  home video master,""  says. But currently, put  master feature film onto DVD require severe compression  current DVD technology cannot hold  much  high-definition film demand. ""As much   compress  picture data rate wise,  also take qualities away   picture   fight  hard  keep   master,""  explains. ""I would love   able  show people  project   work  really look like   high-def world  I find   exciting.""

High-definition DVDs  hold   six time  data   DVDs   use . It  take time though  persuade people  spend money  DVD players  buy  different players  display require  watch high-definition DVDs  18 months' time. Mr Dean  confident though: ""I think   see real HD [high-definition],   heavily compress version  ,     remarkable difference. ""I  hear comment  people  say  image pop   screen.""

High-definition  mean  change   work behind  scenes . On  whole, produce film  high-definition DVDs   easier   ways  less compression  needed. Equally,  may mean Hollywood studios ask     put onto  average DVD. ""When  master movies right ,  data rat  run   1.2 gigabits per second,"" say Mr Dean. ""Our DVDs   put  today    squash    five  six megabits per second. ""That'  huge amount  compression     apply -  98%. So    anything  allow  space,  '   compress  hard.""

Although  step  -converting   bypassed,   realistically  save  day' work, say Mr Dean. One    time consume elements  build DVD navigation  menu systems. On  fairly complex Star Wars disks, make sure  menu button work take 45 human hours alone. If studios want  cash    extra space,  could mean extra human hours,   someone   pay. ""If  decision   studio side     go  put  lot    disks,  could   expensive     extra navigation   required."" And  studios  focus  deliver  ""added value content"", think Mr Dean, ultimately  could mean    want  money  . Those cost could filter    price ticket   high-definition DVD. But   consumer     pay  premium price, studios  listen, think Mr Dean.

High-definition throw   challenge  film makers  DVD production alike. More clarity  screen mean film makers   make doubly sure  attention  detail  meticulous. ""When    first HD version  Star Wars Episode I, everybody   sun-tanned,    make-. ""In  HD version  Episode I,   make- line show ,"" explain Mr Dean. The restoration   older Star Wars episodes reveal  interest items .

""There  scan   corridor [  Death Star]  fairly plainly  one   shots,    file cabinet stick behind one   doorways. ""You never use   able  see   things   blur enough   pan    ' see .""

It could also mean    get films,    format,  widen. ""In  future   go  look towards file delivery  IP [internet protocol - broadband], give  DVD-like experience   set-top box   hard drive,"" say Mr Dean.

"Could Yukos   bless  disguise?

Other things  equal,  notion  entrepreneurs languish  jail   company  sell    song ought   bad  business.

But   looking-glass world  modern Russia,  opposite might   true,  new report*  argued. The study,   Centre  Economic Policy Research,   praise  rough handle  oil company Yukos. But  argue   rigorous tax police  benefit  Russian firms, even target   tax police. ""An increase  tax enforcement  increase  amount [ dividends   income] outside shareholders  receive, even account  increase level  taxation,""  author say.

The paper' reason  complex,   base   sophisticate model   relationship  tax regimes  corporate governance -  particular,  propensity  management  steal   company. The calculations demonstrate  many Russian analysts already knew:  increase  tax rate increase  amount  managers steal, since undeclared income become relatively  valuable. In  West, meanwhile, higher tax rat translate far  smoothly  higher government revenues. On   hand, increase  rigour   tax  collect encourage company  become  transparent, force    able  demonstrate  financial position far  accurately. The net result,  author say,    extra amount company pay  tax    compensate   greater efficiency  financial soundness.

After Vladimir Putin become president  2000,    raise taxes,  put  lot  effort -  much, critics argue -  enforcement.

Since ,  Russian stock market    treble  value,  rise  author attribute  least  part   newly tough approach. The report highlight  case  Sibneft,  Russian oil company  come close  merge  Yukos last year. After Mr Putin come  power,  company' overall effective tax rate rise  2.6%  10.4%,  Sibneft   target   series  aggressive raid  fiscal police. But shareholders benefit hugely: Sibneft start  pay dividends - $53m  2000  almost $1bn  2001 -  close   network  opaque subsidiaries   previously use  siphon  unofficial funds. According   authors, although  variety  change  sweep  Russian industry   time,  increase  tax enforcement    likely explanation   change  fortunes  Sibneft  many   peers.

Does  analysis make sense? In part, certainly. For   faults, corporate Russia  become far  orderly  law-abiding since 2000. Companies  rush  list  share  international stock exchange - something unthinkable   wilder days   1990s -   large firm  produce  account  international standards. Foreign direct investment, long negligible,  start  flow  serious amount - $7bn  2003 -  stock market return   among  healthiest  Europe. But  authors' model   quite cover   complexities. For  start,  model assume   various party  clearly-defined motivation: company want  maximise profit, governments want  maximise tax revenue. In fact,  alarmingly close connections  big business  government  Russia - connections often grease  bribery - blur  apparently antagonistic relationship. Companies ,  example, persuade officials  overlook non-payment  taxes.

And  authors' definition  tax enforcement seem unrealistically Western. Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonder  Russia;  problem  recent examples    erratic  unpredictable way laws  enforced. The case  Yukos,  example,  move  fit  starts,  little clarity   government   intentions,  little faith  investors   letter   law would  followed. As far   commentators  concerned,  state  pursue Yukos    political vendetta, rather  simply  enforce fiscal rectitude.

"Franz man seek government help

""It' go   great  go   I  actually   exercise part   brain tonight.""

I think  government     help --coming artists  discover  scrap  entertainment licence  live venues. Also      help independent record label   louder voice within  industry dominate  commercialise major labels.

Rather  expect  government - .e.  taxpayer -  fork ,  '    megastars put something back ? Some  Britain' wealthiest people  musicians   rake    albums, concert etc. There  far  important demand  government funds.

If   fund football,   fund music?

Areas   arts  fund  government  lottery grants,    music? We already   opera receive huge grant   would clearly  beneficial  diversity  music     opportunities   areas   music. The  problem would    judge  merit state cash.

The government  enough problems fund school  health services. If Alex Kapranos genuinely think  multi-billion pound industry  also  government fund    education  seriously lack   money   put  .

As  Scot live  England, I appreciate  value  Scottish music  culture   success,  I  see  problem  ! Franz Ferdinand, Travis  Snow Patrol   recent examples   success Scottish music     world,       Scots  good   support   goods!

I think  issue   fundamental:   government  spend money  subsidise  multi-million pound industry  health  education     sorry state? The answer   definitely . Those people   lucky enough  pursue  passion  get  pay cheque '  look  government subsidies. I know   I  lucky enough   able  pursue  dream  show jump I would want  finance   I    position  pursue corporate sponsorship.

Yes  government  fund music -  bring joy   masses.

There  already thousands  state-funded musicians   sit around, twiddle  thumb   ""new deal"". Getting  government even  involve would  waste money  could  put  better use.

As long   Government  fund real talent  would   great move. I would hate  see  Pop Idol-type fund  music though,   would  serve  reinforce  stereotype  Alex talk .

Only   proposals make financial sense. Franz Ferdinand must  pay serious amount  tax   record sales -  '   government grant  get start '    pay  back  ,   Treasury would  make far    pay . However,  government  better things  spend  money    give charity  everyone  decide '  musician. The government ' ""fund"" music -   ""invest""  music   investments   treat like   investment.

I think  government need  provide facilities   young group  band  form  practise. The equipment   cheap    well beyond  mean  many people. However, I  feel     extent   role,  provide  condition   talent  flourish  let  go  .

I  agree   government  help  fund music    also  responsibility hold  record companies! They generally always opt   try  test  tend   want  break  mould  risk lose  money  ultimately,  directors    business ! If label     put money forward towards smaller breakthrough act   government '   fork   great deal.

Yeah,  ? Music   government funded, particularly  work  modern composers  veteran bands/artists  stuff. Pop music pretty much rule  earth,   attention  go    fraternities

I agree  fund  arts  make   accessible   public  I   convince  pop music require financial support   taxpayer. There   great deal  money generate  pop music - perhaps  tax  pop could  plough   public performance   form  music  everyone  enjoy. Perhaps  could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music -  ,  music industry sector without  artistic merit  originality whatsoever     specifically design  line  pocket  music producers. Call   tax  music ""pollution"",   like.

Though I really like Franz Ferdinand, I   disagree  Mr Kapranos. Once government get  hand   private sector,   destroy  creative  possibly controversial avenues  artist pursues. Many years ago,    case   US NEA,   government start  question   consider art   money   allotting. The solution Mr Kapranos  pursue would  privately-funded organizations, like Save  Music   US.

"Why  target  better  many

The economic target set    Lisbon summit  European Union leaders  2000  mean  help Europe leapfrog  way past  United States  become  world' lead economy  2010.

But  Lisbon target   much    economic prestige. For many economists  analysts    ensure Europe ' become  global economic laggard. They  also  ensure Europe  continue  compete   equal   grow economic giants  Asia, India  China,  well    economic might   United States. That'     tone  urgency   report,   Wednesday,   former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok. Mr Kok  commission   European Commission  March  year  assess  far  EU  come towards meet  Lisbon targets, five years    inception. His conclusion  simple:  many   target   seriously missed.

Lisbon risk become  ""synonym  miss objectives  fail promises"",  report said. ""The status quo    option.""

At risk   medium  long run  nothing less   sustainability   society Europe  built,  said. The report come   time  Europe' competitive position  waning. The EU' economic growth rate  project   2%  year  2.4% next. While    growth  overall employment rat  Europe, productivity lag behind    US. But meet  Lisbon target require  political commitment   EU member state  volunteer  far. That   part  due   state   global economy   past  years.

As Mr Kok' report noted: ""The ink  scarcely dry   [Lisbon] agreement   worldwide stock market bubble imploded."" ""The US suffer two years  economic slowdown  recession   European economy follow suit.""

The circumstances ' conducive  create  20 million new job promise  EU leaders  Lisbon  2000. Neither   conducive  get governments  spend   research  development, money need   EU   meet  target  become  -called ""knowledge-based economy"". ""The [Lisbon] vision   compel one,   order    society   change,"" say Paul Hofheinz   Lisbon Council,  Brussels-based citizen action group. ""What  find    lot  people   fight change. You find trade unions fight change. But also  employers' associations. ""Even though  tell  '  favour  change, many  actually push  less competition,  subsidy  less free market activity.""

But part   problem  also link   original target set   Lisbon five years ago. Targets   habit  come back  haunt     Lisbon case,  cover  much, accord   Wim report. Economic growth  job creation  link  issue range  environmental protection  social inclusion,  even safety  sea. The agenda    broad    result nothing  prioritised.

""Lisbon   everything  thus  nothing,""  Kok report said. ""Everybody  responsible  thus  one."" That'   Kok report recommend   Lisbon target  narrow   14 key indicators,   emphasis  create job  economic growth. It also recommend   European Commission draw   league table  rank countries accord   step ' take towards meet  targets, effectively ""naming, sham  faming"". ""Rhetoric  delivery ' necessarily go hand  hand,"" Mr Kok say   press conference alongside  publication   report. ""We '   luxury anymore   exchange politeness  one another.""

On one point Mr Kok   clear: The European Union   try  emulate  US economy. The European economic  social model need  change,    much   social  environmental issue take  backseat  economic growth. In  sense,  Lisbon agenda  sail  unchartered waters. The Kok report try   away   belief  job need   sacrifice   altar  economic growth. ""It'  ambitious,"" say John Palmer, political director   European Policy Centre,  Brussels-based think-tank. ""This  something   advance economy   world  try  . It' go  require quite new  innovative policies."" But  analysts believe   Kok report ' come    sort  innovative policies  think need  make  Lisbon target  reality. For example,  recommend put  place policies  encourage women  older people  remain   workforce. But  ' say  company   convince   . It      incoming president   European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso,  adopt Mr Kok' recommendations  press   EU governments. Mr Barroso  say   EU' competitiveness    top priority. He expect  five-year term  office   judge  Europe' success  meet  Lisbon agenda.
