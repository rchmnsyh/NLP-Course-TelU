how political squabble snowball  it become commonplace to argue that blair and brown be like squabble school kid and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bicker  but this analysis in fact get it wrong it not just children who fight - adults do too and there be solid reason why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its get go the key feature of an endless feud be that everyone can agree they'd be better off if it end - but everyone want to have the last word  each participant genuinely want the row to stop but think it worth prolong the argument just a tiny bite to ensure their view be hear their successive attempt to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument go on and on and on (in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive book be publish ensure the issue never die) now this isn't because the participants be stupid - it actually each individual behave entirely rationally give the incentives face them indeed there even a piece of economic theory that explain all this nothing as obscure as post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quote - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks be familiar with  it often refer to as the prisoner dilemma base on a parable much tell in economics degree course about a sheriff and two prisoners the story go that two prisoners be jointly charge with a heinous crime and be lock up in separate cells but the sheriff desperately need a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trump up charge  clearly the prisoners' best strategy be to keep their mouth shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff have an idea to induce them to talk he tell each prisoner separately that if they confess - and they be the only one to confess - they'll be let off their crime and he tell them that if they don't confess - and they be the only one not to confess - they'll get life now if you be prisoner confront with this choice your best bet be to confess if your partner doesn't confess you'll get off completely and if your partner do confess you'd better confess to ensure you don't get life the result be of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff do not have to let either one off both prisoners' individual logic be to behave that way even though both would have be better if they have somehow agree to shut up don't worry if you don't entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google where there be 283000 entries on it  the prisoners' dilemma and all its ramifications have truly capture economists in the last couple of decades it be a parable use to describe any situation where there be an obvious sensible choice to be take collectively but where the only rational choice individually be to behave selfishly  a cold war arm race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arm rather than a lot of arm but as long as each want just a few more arm than the other an arm race ensue with the result that the individually logical decision to buy more arm result in arm level that be too high what economics tell us be that once you're in a prisoners' dilemma - unless you be repeat the experience many time over - it hard to escape the perverse logic of it it no good just exhort people to stop buy arm or to stop argue when all their incentives encourage them to carry on somehow the incentives have to change  in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camp be as bad as the report suggest solomon wisdom need to be deploy to solve the problem every parent know there be ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants an example be the famous rule that one divide the other choose as a way of allocate a piece of cake to be slice up between greedy children in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who have the last word be one who lose rather than the one who win the row the cost of prolong the row by even one more brief or one more book for that matter have to exceed the benefit of have the last word and get your point in if the rest of the party can enforce that they'll have the protagonists retreat pretty quickly

what high-definition will do to dvds  first it be the humble home video then it be the dvd and now hollywood be prepare for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition  high-definition give incredible 3d-like picture and surround sound the dvd disk and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at be still a number of issue to be sort out but when high-definition film do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high-definition future be an excite prospect he have work on the star war dvd trilogy find nemo the incredibles and indiana jones there be a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world be two completely separate worlds he tell the bbc news website  the technology we be deal with now mean they be very much conjoin the film that we see in theatres be come from the same digital file that we take the home video master he say but currently put a master feature film onto dvd require severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition film demand as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explain i would love to be able to show people what project that we work on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very excite  high-definition dvds can hold up to six time more data than the dvds we be use to it will take time though to persuade people who spend money on dvd players to buy the different players and display require to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months' time mr dean be confident though i think if they see real hd [high-definition] not some heavily compress version of it there be such a remarkable difference i have hear comment from people who say the image pop off the screen  high-definition will mean some change for those work behind the scenes too on the whole produce film for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression be need equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd when we master movies right now our data rat be run at about 12 gigabits per second say mr dean our dvds that we put out today have to be squash down to about five or six megabits per second that a huge amount of compression that have to be apply - about 98% so if you have anything that allow more space you don't have to compress so hard studios could fit a lot more market material game and feature onto high-capacity dvds currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months say mr dean although the step of down-converting will be bypass this will realistically only save a day work say mr dean one of the most time consume elements be build dvd navigation and menu systems on the fairly complex star war disk make sure the menu button work take 45 human hours alone if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone have to pay if the decision on the studio side be that they be go to put a lot more on these disk it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that be require and if studios do focus on deliver more add value content think mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it those cost could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd but if the consumer be not will to pay a premium price studios will listen think mr dean  high-definition throw up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike more clarity on screen mean film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail be meticulous when we do the first hd version of star war episode i everybody be very sun-tanned but that be make-up in the hd version of episode i all these make-up line show up explain mr dean the restoration of the older star war episodes reveal some interest items too  there be scan of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots there be a file cabinet stick behind one of the doorways you never use to be able to see it because things be just blur enough during the pan that you just didn't see it what high-definition revolution ultimately mean be that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur with home theatre systems turn live room into cinemas this line blur even further it could also mean that how we get film and in what format will widen in the future we be go to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband] give a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive say mr dean but that be some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves

paris promise raise welsh hop  have there be a better six nations match than saturday epic in paris  and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978 those be the two question occupy not just wales supporters but rugby fan as a whole after a scintillate display in paris welsh legend mervyn davies a member of two of three grand slam-winning side of the 1970s hail it as one of the great performances of the past three decades martyn williams wales' two-try scorer on the day call it one of the most surreal game i have ever play in a crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observe there be a french half and there be a welsh half and what a half it be for the red dragonhood transform a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerise minutes of the second period but while that passage of play show the swell self-belief of a side prepare to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter tell us a whole lot more about this welsh side that they recover from a batter in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time then reverse it on the resumption be remarkable enough but in resist a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes wales show not only their physical attribute but their mental resolve  in international rugby any of the top seven side can beat each other on a give day but the great side be those that win the close contest on a consistent basis england suffer some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forge bond that ultimately lead to victory when it really matter wales have some way to go before they can be remotely consider in a similar light but the sign be that players previously on the receive end be learn how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline ten of the 22 on duty on saturday be also involve when wales be trounce 33-5 in paris two years ago but since they throw off the shackle against new zealand in the 2003 world cup wales have rediscover much of what make them a great rugby nation in the first place  the confidence in the squad have be build and build since the world cup and we now have young players who be become world class note coach mike ruddock the like of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson be certainly build strong case for inclusion on this summer lions tour to new zealand and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas be prove it be not only the youngsters that be on an upward curve jones after his superb man-of-the-match display observe that we be a very happy camp now ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensure the tribal and regional divisions that have often scar welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad the  joie de vivre  so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stem from a style of play that first woo supporters the world over in the 1970s  if england have half the innate attack exuberance wales have produce in this championship they would not be contemplate the debris of three consecutive defeat similarly wales have learn that style alone do not win match and that forward power mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure be equally important so on to murrayfield where wales have not win on their last three visit while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beat scotland only then - with the visit of ireland to finish - can they start think about emulate the hallow players of the 1970s and write their own name into welsh legend

could yukos be a bless in disguise  other things be equal the notion of entrepreneurs languish in jail while their company be sell off for a song ought to be bad for business  but in the looking-glass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true a new report* have argue the study from the centre for economic policy research do not praise the rough handle of oil company yukos but it argue that more rigorous tax police have benefit all russian firm even target of the tax police an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive even account for increase level of taxation the author say  the paper reason be complex and be base on a sophisticate model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company the calculations demonstrate what many russian analysts already know that increase the tax rate increase the amount that managers steal since undeclared income become relatively more valuable in the west meanwhile higher tax rat translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues on the other hand increase the rigour with which tax be collect encourage company to become more transparent force them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately the net result the author say be that the extra amount company pay in tax be more than compensate for by greater efficiency and financial soundness  after vladimir putin become president in 2000 he do not raise tax but put a lot of effort - too much critics argue - into enforcement  since then the russian stock market have more than treble in value a rise the author attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach the report highlight the case of sibneft a russian oil company that come close to merge with yukos last year after mr putin come to power the company overall effective tax rate rise from 26% to 104% and sibneft be the target of a series of aggressive raid by fiscal police but shareholders benefit hugely sibneft start to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and close down the network of opaque subsidiaries it have previously use for siphon off unofficial fund accord to the author although a variety of change be sweep through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement be the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peer  do this analysis make sense in part certainly for all its fault corporate russia have become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000 company have rush to list their share on international stock exchange - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firm now produce their account to international standards foreign direct investment long negligible be start to flow in serious amount - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market return have be among the healthiest in europe but the authors' model do not quite cover all the complexities for a start the model assume that the various party have clearly-defined motivation company want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often grease by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship company can for example persuade officials to overlook non-payment of tax  and the authors' definition of tax enforcement seem unrealistically western genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonder in russia the problem with recent examples have be the erratic and unpredictable way laws be enforce the case against yukos for example have move in fit and start with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be follow as far as most commentators be concern the state be pursue yukos out of a political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude since yukos' founder mikhail khodorkovsky be arrest a year ago the russian market have drop by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance

franz man seek government help  franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos have call for more government help for musicians while take part in an edinburgh lecture discussion  for any cultural output to thrive there need to be some kind of state input to that as well he say but kapranos warn against musicians be too closely link with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians be to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he say  kapranos join the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland role in make 21st century music there be elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren't self-sufficient he say but so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warn musicians against be ally to a particular party however i don't know if have tea with politicians be always a good idea  kapranos and his glasgow four-piece band have be nominate for five prize at next week brit award include best group and best album their self-titled debut album win last year mercury music prize and spawn three top 20 single he tell the 300-strong audience at the university reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restrict by stereotype we say 'i like this' because i listen to nirvana and korn i be a trouble individual i'm riddle with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because i'm upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos say there be a general hostility towards classical music add there be very little do to break that hostility other than classic fm  he conclude we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer jam macmillan agree we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lecture series have include former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawk kapranos describe his appearance on wednesday as more daunt by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i don't really care about the brits he say it go to be great to go down but i have actually have to exercise part of my brain tonight  i think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discover by scrap the entertainment licence for live venues also they should do more to help independent record label have a louder voice within an industry dominate by commercialise major label  rather than expect the government - ie the taxpayer - to fork out why don't some of the megastars put something back in some of britain wealthiest people be musicians who have rake it in from albums concert etc there be far more important demand on government fund  if they can fund football why not fund music  areas of the arts be fund by government and lottery grant so why not music we already have the opera receive huge grant and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merit state cash  the government have enough problems fund school and health service if alex kapranos genuinely think a multi-billion pound industry should also have government fund then his own education be seriously lack and more money should be put into that  as a scot live in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture be a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol be just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots be good at and support our own goods  i think the issue be more fundamental should the government be spend money on subsidise a multi-million pound industry when health and education be in such a sorry state the answer be most definitely no those people who be lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn't be look for government subsidies i know that if i be lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jump i would want to finance myself until i be in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship  yes the government should fund music - it bring joy to the mass  there be already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sit around twiddle their thumb on the new deal get the government even more involve would only waste money that could be put to better use  as long as the government be fund real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idol-type fund of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotype that alex talk about  only if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be pay serious amount of tax on their record sales - if they'd have a government grant to get start they'd have more than pay it back by now so the treasury would be make far more than it pay out however the government have better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decide they're a musician the government shouldn't fund music - it should invest in music and those investments should be treat like any other investment  i think the government need to provide facilities and for young group and band to form and practise the equipment be not cheap and can be well beyond the mean of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the condition for the talent to flourish and let it go from there  i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there be also a responsibility hold by record company they generally always opt for the try and test and tend not to want to break any mould or risk lose any money which ultimately the directors be in the business for if label be more will to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough act then the government wouldn't have to fork out a great deal  yeah why not music should be government fund particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff pop music pretty much rule the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities  i agree with fund the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i be not convince that pop music require financial support from the taxpayer there be a great deal of money generate through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be plough into the public performance of other form of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that be the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which be specifically design to line the pocket of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you like  though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government get their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursue many years ago this be the case with the us nea when the government start to question what be consider art for the money they be allot the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations like save the music in the us

time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager a friendly provide an important opportunity to work with your players  the only problem be that the game itself can often be a farce some people have be say it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the 90 minutes at the end  i would say it 50-50 whether you should have these game or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not do so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players return to domestic duty injure but international boss will tell you that scrap friendlies be counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better be by play the more you play together the easier it be when it come to the crunch in game like world cup quarter-finals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and it very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few change let alone a whole team worth the debate will rage on and i'm not sure there be a satisfactory solution one manager who have get it right this week be walter smith the new scotland manager have decide to have a train camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replace berti vogts it be the sort of move you would expect from walter who be a canny manager  the players have have such a hard time recently that he be better off get them together in a relax atmosphere and try to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he have send them out on wednesday and they have be badly beat it would have do them no good whatsoever john toshack have his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public want result it extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it become a stat that can be use against you england game against holland be a good example it look like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart down or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have get to remember sven-goran eriksson side be give a lesson by spain in the last game they play  the injury problems in defence should at least give the like of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of wait at home with finger cross

immigration to be election issue  immigration and asylum have normally be issue politicians from the big party have tiptoe around at election time  but no longer both labour and the tories have signal their intention of make them central to their election campaign they have be strike by the level of concern amongst voters about the issue with internal survey show they have the potential to swing large number of vote that be also true at the last general election and the issue do briefly become a campaign issue but it spark the probably predictable furore with claim politicians be either stoke up xenophobia or alternatively run scar of address the problem but this time around it look set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big party compete to set out tough policies  the tories be already commit to impose annual limit on immigration with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications process outside the uk labour have already brand the proposal unworkable but party strategists have see the tories seize a poll advantage over the issue  now home secretary charles clarke have come up with alternative proposals for a point system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be grant entry and to kick out more fail asylum seekers that have be attack by the tories as too little too late and for fail to tackle the key issue of the number enter the uk the liberal democrats have not be draw too deeply into the argument but have call for a europe-wide policy on immigration  but while all the party appear to agree the time have come to properly debate and address the issue there be already sign they will run into precisely the same problems as before former union leader sir bill morris have already accuse both the big party of engage in a bid war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers  my concern be that whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate right-wing political party pick up on statements like `burden to britain' will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty it be precisely that concern - and the possible suggestion the issue be play to the far right racist agenda - that will provoke strong reactions from many concern with this issue the challenge for the big party be to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoid that trap

why few target be better than many  the economic target set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 be mean to help europe leapfrog its way past the unite state to become the world lead economy by 2010  but the lisbon target be about much more than just economic prestige for many economists and analysts they be about ensure europe doesn't become a global economic laggard they be also about ensure europe can continue to compete as an equal with the grow economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the unite state that why there be a tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok mr kok be commission by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu have come towards meet the lisbon target five years on from their inception his conclusion be simple too many of the target will be seriously miss  lisbon risk become a synonym for miss objectives and fail promise his report say the status quo be not an option  at risk in the medium to long run be nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe have build it say the report come at a time when europe competitive position be wan the eu economic growth rate be project to be 2% this year and 24% next while there have be growth in overall employment rat in europe productivity lag behind that of the us but meet the lisbon target require a political commitment that no eu member state have volunteer so far that have in part be due to the state of the global economy in the past few years  as mr kok report note the ink have scarcely dry on the [lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble implode the us suffer two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy follow suit  the circumstances weren't conducive to create the 20 million new job promise by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000 neither be they conducive to get governments to spend more on research and development money need if the eu be to meet its target of become a so-called knowledge-based economy the [lisbon] vision be a compel one but in order to do it society have to change say paul hofheinz of the lisbon council a brussels-based citizen action group what you find be that a lot of people have be fight change you find trade unions fight change but also the employers' associations even though they tell you they're in favour of change many be actually push for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity  but part of the problem be also link to the original target set out in lisbon five years ago target have a habit of come back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they cover too much accord to the wim report economic growth and job creation be link to issue range from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea the agenda be just too broad and as a result nothing be prioritise  lisbon be about everything and thus about nothing the kok report say everybody be responsible and thus no one that why the kok report recommend that the lisbon target be narrow down to 14 key indicators with an emphasis on create job and economic growth it also recommend that the european commission draw up a league table which rank countries accord to the step they're take towards meet the target effectively name sham and faming rhetoric and delivery don't necessarily go hand in hand mr kok say in a press conference alongside the publication of his report we don't have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another  on one point mr kok be very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy the european economic and social model need to change but not so much so that social and environmental issue take a backseat to economic growth in that sense the lisbon agenda be sail into unchartered water the kok report try to do away with a belief that job need to be sacrifice at the altar of economic growth it very ambitious say john palmer political director at the european policy centre a brussels-based think-tank this be something that no advance economy in the world have try to do it go to require quite new and innovative policies but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and think need to make the lisbon target a reality for example it recommend put in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce but it doesn't say how company should be convince to do this it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr kok recommendations and press them on eu governments mr barroso have say that the eu competitiveness will be his top priority he expect his five-year term in office to be judge on europe success in meet the lisbon agenda
